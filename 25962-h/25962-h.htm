<h2>WHAT CAUSED THE WAR</h2>

<h3>BARON BEYENS</h3>


<h3>I</h3>

<div class="sidenote">Political
designs of
Francis
Ferdinand.</div>

<p>The Archduke Francis Ferdinand will go
down to posterity without having yielded
up his secret. Great political designs have
been ascribed to him, mainly on the strength
of his friendship with William II. What do we
really know about him? He was strong-willed
and obstinate, very Clerical, very Austrian, disliking
the Hungarians to such an extent that
he kept their statesmen at arm's-length, and
having no love for Italy. He has been credited
with sympathies towards the Slav elements of
the Empire; it has been asserted that he dreamt
of setting up, in place of the dual monarchy, a
"triune State," in which the third factor would
have been made up for the most part of Slav
provinces carved out of the Kingdom of St.
Stephen. Immediately after he had been murdered,
the <i>Vossische Zeitung</i> refuted this theory
with arguments which seemed to me thoroughly
sound.</p>

<p>The Archduke, said the Berlin newspaper,
was too keen-witted not to see that he would
thus be creating two rivals for Austria instead
of one, and that the Serb populations
would come within the orbit of Belgrade rather
than of Vienna. Serbia would become the Piedmont
of the Balkans; she would draw to herself
the Slavs of the Danube valley by a process of
crystallization similar to that which brought
about Italian unity.</p>


<div class="sidenote">Army and
Navy reorganized.</div>

<p>From year to year the Archduke had acquired<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
more and more weight in the governance of the
Empire, in proportion as his uncle's will grew
weaker beneath the burden of advancing age.
Thus he had succeeded in his efforts to provide
Austria-Hungary with a new navy, the counterpart,
on a more modest scale, of the German
fleet, and to reorganize the effective army, here
again taking Germany for his model. Among
certain cliques, he was accused of not keeping
enough in the background, of showing little tact
or consideration in the manner of thrusting
aside the phantom Emperor, who was gently
gliding into the winter of the years at Sch&ouml;nbrunn
amid the veneration of his subjects of
every race.</p>

<p>Another charge was that he appointed too
many of his creatures to important civil and
military posts.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Antagonism
of
Russia
and
Austria.</div>

<p>We may well believe that this prince, observing
the gradual decay of the monarchy, tried
to restore its vigour, and that his first thought
was to hold with a firm grasp, even before assuming
the Imperial crown, the cluster of
nationalities, mutually hostile and always discontented,
that go to make up the Dual Empire.
So far as foreign relations are concerned, we
may assume that he was bent on winning her
a place in the first rank of Powers; that he
wished, above all, to see her predominant all
along the Danube and in the Balkans; that
he even aimed at giving her the road to Salonika
and the Levant, though it were at the
price of a collision with Russia. This antagonism
between the two neighbour Empires must
have often been among the topics of his conversations
with William II.</p>

<p>The Archduke needed military glory, prestige
won on the battle-field, in order to seat
his consort firmly on the throne and make his
children heirs to the C&aelig;sars. He had been
suspected, both in Austria and abroad, of not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
wishing to observe the family compact which
he had signed at the time of his marriage with
Countess Sophie Chotek. It was thought that
he perhaps reserved the right to declare it null
and void, in view of the constraint that had
been put upon him. The successive honours
that had drawn the Duchess of Hohenberg from
the obscurity in which the morganatic wife of
a German prince is usually wrapped, and had
brought her near to the steps of the throne,
showed clearly that her rise would not stop
half-way.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Domestic
life of
the Archduke.</div>

<p>The Archduke, like William II himself,
was reputed to be an exemplary father and
husband. He was one of those princes who
adore their own children, but, under the spur
of political ambition, are very prone to send
the children of others to the shambles. A fine
theme for Socialist and Republican preachers
to enlarge upon!</p>

<p>I often met the heir to the Imperial crown,
especially at Vienna in 1910, where I had the
honour of accompanying my Sovereign, and two
years later at Munich, the Prince Regent's
funeral.</p>

<p>On each occasion this Hapsburg, with his
heavy features, his scowling expression, and
his rather corpulent figure (quite different from
the slim build characteristic of his line), struck
me as a singular type. His face was certainly
not sympathetic, nor was his manner engaging.
The Duchess of Hohenberg, whom, after
having known her as a little girl when her
father was Austrian Minister at Brussels, I
found gracefully doing the honours in the Belvedere
Palace, had retained in her high station
the genial simplicity of the Chotek family. This
probably did not prevent her from cherishing
the loftiest ambitions for herself, and above all
for her eldest son, and from coveting the glory
of the double crown.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>


<h3>II</h3>

<div class="sidenote">Assassination
of
Francis
Ferdinand.</div>

<p>The news that an assassin's hand had struck
down the Archduke and his wife, inseparable
even in death, burst upon Berlin on the afternoon
of Sunday, June 28, like an unexpected
thunderclap in the midst of a calm summer's
day. I went over at once to the Austro-Hungarian
Embassy, in order to express all the horror
that I felt at this savage drama. Count
Sz&ouml;gyen, the senior member of the diplomatic
corps, was on the eve of resigning the post that
he had held for twenty years, honoured by all
his colleagues. It was whispered that his removal
had been asked for by the Archduke, who
was anxious to introduce young blood into the
diplomatic service. I found the Ambassador
quite overcome by the terrible news. He seemed
stricken with grief at the thought of his aged
Sovereign, who had already lost so many of his
nearest and dearest, and of the Dual Empire,
robbed of its most skillful pilot, and with no
one to steer it now but an octogenarian leaning
on a youth of twenty-six. M. Cambon had come
to the Embassy at the same time, and we left
together discussing the results, still impossible
to foresee clearly, that this fatality might have
for European affairs.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Serajevo
tragedy a
menace.</div>

<p>From the very next day the tone of the Berlin
Press, in commenting on the Serajevo tragedy,
was full of menace. It expected the Vienna
Cabinet to send to Belgrade an immediate request
for satisfaction, if Serbian subjects, as it
was believed, were among those who had devised
and carried out the plot. But how far
would this satisfaction go, and in what form
would it be demanded? There was the rub.
The report, issued by the semi-official <i>Lokalanzeiger</i>,
of a pressure exerted by the Austro-Hungarian
Minister, with a view to making<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
the Serbian Government institute proceedings
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'again'">against</ins> the anarchist societies of which the Archduke
and his wife had been the victims, surprised
no one, but was not confirmed. On the
other hand, a softer breeze soon blew from
Vienna and Budapest, and under its influence
the excitement of the Berlin newspapers suddenly
abated. An order seemed to have been
issued: the rage and fluster of the public were
to be allowed to cool down. The Austro-Hungarian
Government, so we were informed by
the news agencies, were quietly taking steps
to prosecute the murderers. Count Berchtold,
in speaking to the diplomatic corps at Vienna,
and Count Tisza, in addressing Parliament at
Budapest, used reassuring language, which
raised hopes of a peaceful solution.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Opinion is
moderate
in Berlin.</div>

<p>The Wilhelmstrasse also expressed itself in
very measured terms on the guarantees that
would be demanded from Serbia. Herr Zimmermann,
without knowing (so he said to me)
what decision had been arrived at in Vienna,
thought that no action would be taken in Belgrade
until the Austro-Hungarian Government
had collected the proofs of the complicity of
Serbian subjects or societies in the planning of
the Serajevo crime. He had made a similar
statement to the Russian Ambassador, who had
hastened to impart to him his fears for the
peace of Europe, in the event of any attempt to
coerce Serbia into proceeding against the secret
societies, if they were accused of intrigues
against the Austrian Government in Bosnia
and Croatia. Herr Zimmermann declared to
M. Sverbeeff that, in his opinion, no better
advice could be given to the Serbian Government
than this: that it should put a stop to
the nefarious work of these societies and punish
the accomplices of the Archduke's assassins.
The moderation of this remark fairly reflected
the general state of public opinion in Berlin.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Kaiser
William's
opinion.</div>

<p>But what of the Emperor, the Archduke's
personal friend? Would not his grief and anger
find voice in ringing tones? All eyes were
turned towards Kiel, where the fatal news
reached William II while he was taking part in
a yacht race on board his own clipper. He
turned pale, and was heard to murmur: "So my
work of the past twenty-five years will have to
be started all over again!" Enigmatic words
which may be interpreted in various ways! To
the British Ambassador, who was also at Kiel,
with the British squadron returning from the
Baltic, he unburdened himself in more explicit
fashion: "Es ist ein Verbrechen gegen das
Deutschtum" ("It is a crime against Germanity").
By this he probably meant that Germany,
feeling her own interests assailed by the
Serajevo crime, would make common cause with
Austria to exact a full retribution. With more
self-control than usual, however, he abstained
from all further public utterances on the
subject.</p>

<p>It had been announced that he would go to
Vienna to attend the Archduke's funeral. What
were the motives that prevented him from
offering to the dead man this last token of a
friendship which, at first merely political,
had become genuine and even tender, with
a touch of patronage characteristic of the
Emperor?</p>

<div class="sidenote">William
II not
at the
funeral.</div>

<p>He excused himself on the ground of some
slight ailment. The truth is, no doubt, that
he was disgusted with the wretched stickling
for etiquette shown by the Grand Chamberlain
of the Viennese Court, the Prince di Montenuovo,
who refused to celebrate with fitting
splendour the obsequies of the late heir apparent
and his morganatic wife. Under these
circumstances, Vienna could have no desire
either for the presence of William II or for his
criticisms.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Kaiser
goes to
Norway.</div>

<p>At the beginning of July, the Emperor left
for his accustomed cruise along the Norwegian
coast, and in Berlin we breathed more freely.
If he could withdraw so easily from the centre
of things, it was a sign that the storm-clouds
that had nearly burst over Serbia were also
passing off from the Danube valley. Such, I
fancy, was the view taken by the British Government,
for its Ambassador, who was already
away on leave, was not sent back to Berlin.
Other diplomats, among them the Russian Ambassador,
took their annual holiday as usual.
But the Emperor, in the remote fiords of Norway,
was all the time posted up in the secret
designs of the Vienna Cabinet. The approaching
ultimatum to Serbia was telegraphed to
him direct by his Ambassador in Vienna, Herr
von Tschirsky, a very active worker, who strenuously
advocated a policy of hostility towards
Russia, and from the first moment had wanted
war.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Kaiser
decides.</div>

<p>We may assume that the Emperor, if his
mind was not already made up at Kiel, came
to a decision during his Norwegian cruise. His
departure for the north had been merely a
snare, a device for throwing Europe and the
Triple Entente off the scent, and for lulling
them into a false security. While the world
imagined that he was merely seeking to soothe
his nerves and recruit his strength with the
salt sea breezes, he was biding his time for a
dramatic reappearance on the stage of events,
allowing the introductory scenes to be played
in his absence.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>During the first half of July, my colleagues
and I at Berlin did not live in a fool's paradise.
As the deceptive calm caused by Vienna's
silence was prolonged, a latent, ill-defined uneasiness<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
took hold of us more and more. Yet
we were far from anticipating that in the
space of a few days we should be driven
into the midst of a diplomatic maelstrom,
in which, after a week of intense anguish, we
should look on, mute and helpless, at the
shipwreck of European peace and of all our
hopes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Austria's
ultimatum
to Serbia.</div>

<p>The ultimatum, sent in the form of a Note
by Baron von Giesl to the Serbian Cabinet on
July 23, was not disclosed by the Berlin newspapers
until the following day, in their morning
editions. This bolt from the blue proved
more alarming than anything we had dared
to imagine. The shock was so unexpected that
certain journals, losing their composure,
seemed to regard the Vienna Cabinet's arraignment
as having overshot the mark. "Austria-Hungary,"
said the <i>Vossische Zeitung</i>,
"will have to justify the grave charges that
she makes against the Serbian Government
and people by publishing the results of the
preliminary investigations at Serajevo."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Russia
would
defend
Serbia.</div>

<p>My own conviction, shared by several of my
colleagues, was that the Austrian and Hungarian
statesmen could not have brought themselves
to risk such a blow at the Balkan kingdom,
without having consulted their colleagues
at Berlin and ascertained that the Emperor
William would sanction the step. His horror
of regicides and his keen sense of dynastic
brotherhood might explain why he left his
ally a free hand, in spite of the danger of provoking
a European conflict. That danger was
only too real. Not for one moment did I suppose
that Russia would prove so careless of
Serbia's fate as to put up with this daring assault
on the latter's sovereignty and independence;
that the St. Petersburg Cabinet would renounce
the principle of "The Balkans for the
Balkan nations," proclaimed to the Duma two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
months before by M. Sazonoff, in short, that
the Russian people would disown the ancient
ties of blood that united it with the Slav communities
of the Balkan peninsula.</p>

<p>The pessimistic feeling of the diplomatic
corps was increased on the following day, the
25th, by the language addressed to it at the
Wilhelmstrasse. Herren von Jagow and Zimmermann
said that they had not known beforehand
the contents of the Austrian Note. This
was a mere quibble: they had not known its
actual wording, I grant, but they had certainly
been apprised of its tenor. They hastened to
add, by the way, that the Imperial Government
approved of its ally's conduct, and did
not consider the tone of its communication unduly
harsh. The Berlin Press, still with the
exception of the Socialist organs, had recovered
from its astonishment of the day before; it
joined in the chorus of the Vienna and Budapest
newspapers, from which it gave extracts,
and faced the prospect of a war with perfect
calm, while expressing the hope that it would
remain localized.</p>

<div class="sidenote">No signs
of peaceful
settlement.</div>

<p>In comparison with the attitude of the German
Government and Press, the signs pointing
to a peaceful settlement seemed faint indeed.
They all came from outside Germany, from the
impressions recorded in foreign telegrams.
Public opinion in Europe could not grasp the
need for such hectoring methods of obtaining
satisfaction, when there was no case for refusing
discussion on the normal diplomatic
lines. It seemed impossible that Count Berchtold
should ignore the general movement of
reproof which appeared spontaneously everywhere
but in Berlin against his ultimatum.
A moderate claim would have seemed just; but
Serbia could not be asked to accept a demand
for so heavy an atonement, couched in a form
of such unexampled brutality.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Key to
the situation
in
Berlin.</div>

<p>The more I reflected on the ghastly situation
created by the collusion of German and Austro-Hungarian
diplomacy, the more certain did I
feel that the key to that situation (as M. Sazonoff
said later) lay in Berlin, and that there
was no need to look further for the solution
of the problem. If, however, the choice between
peace and war was left to the discretion of
the Emperor William, whose influence over his
ally in Vienna had always overruled that of
others, then, considering what I knew as to
His Majesty's personal inclinations and the
plans of the General Staff, the upshot of it all
was no longer in doubt, and no hope of a peaceful
arrangement could any longer be entertained.
I communicated this dismal forecast
to the French Ambassador, whom I went to see
on the evening of the 25th. Like myself, M.
Cambon laboured under no illusions. That
very night I wrote to my Government, in order
to acquaint it with my fears and urge it to
be on its guard. This report, dated the 26th,
I entrusted, as a measure of precaution, to one
of my secretaries, who at once left for Brussels.
Early next morning, my dispatch was in the
hands of the Belgian Foreign Minister.</p>

<div class="sidenote">War
aimed at
Russia
and
France.</div>

<p>The ultimatum to Serbia [it ran] is a blow
contrived by Vienna and Berlin, or rather, contrived
here and carried out at Vienna. Requital
for the assassination of the Austrian heir
apparent and the Pan-Serb propaganda serves
as a stalking-horse. The real aim, apart from
the crushing of Serbia and the stifling of Jugo-Slav
aspirations, is to deal a deadly thrust at
Russia and France, with the hope that England
will stand aside from the struggle. In order
to vindicate this theory, I beg to remind you of
the view prevailing in the German General Staff,
namely, that a war with France and Russia is
unavoidable and close at hand&mdash;a view which
the Emperor has been induced to share. This<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
war, eagerly desired by the military and Pan-German
party, might be undertaken to-day under
conditions extremely favourable for Germany,
conditions that are not likely to arise
again for some time to come.</p>

<p>After a summary of the situation and of the
problems that it raised, my report concluded as
follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>We, too, have to ask ourselves these harassing
questions, and keep ourselves ready for the
worst; for the European conflict that has always
been talked about, with the hope that it
would never break out, is to-day becoming a
grim reality.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dangers
for
Belgium.</div>

<p>The worst contingencies that occurred to me,
as a Belgian, were the violation of a part of our
territory and the duty that might fall upon our
soldiers of barring the way to the belligerents.
In view of the vast area over which a war between
France and Germany would be fought,
dared we hope that Belgium would be safe from
any attack by the German army, from any attempt
to use her strategic routes for offensive
purposes? I could not bring myself to believe
that she would be so fortunate. But between
such tentatives and a thoroughgoing invasion
of my country, plotted a long time in advance
and carried out before the real operations of
the war had begun, there was a wide gulf, a gulf
that I never thought the Imperial Government
capable of leaping over with a light heart, because
of the European complications which so
reckless a disdain for treaties would not fail to
involve.</p></div>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>Until the end of the crisis, the idea of a preventive
war continually recurred to my mind.
Other heads of legations, however, while sharing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
my anxieties on this point, did not agree
with me as to the premeditation of which I
accused the Emperor and the military chiefs.
I was not content with putting my questions to
the French Ambassador, whose unerring judgment
always carried great weight with me. I
also visited his Italian colleague, an astute
diplomat, thoroughly versed in German statecraft.
He had always put me in mind of those
dexterous agents employed by the sixteenth-century
Italian republics.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Signor
Bollati's
views.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Germany
and
Austria
confident.</div>

<p>According to Signor Bollati, the German
Government, agreeing in principle with the
Vienna Cabinet as to the necessity for chastising
Serbia, had not known beforehand the
terms of the Austrian Note, the violence of
which was unprecedented in the language of
Chancelleries. Vienna, as well as Berlin, was
convinced that Russia, in spite of the official
assurances that had recently passed between
the Tsar and M. Poincar&eacute; regarding the complete
readiness of the French and Russian
armies, was not in a position to enter on
a European war, and that she would not
dare to embark upon so hazardous an adventure.
Internal troubles, revolutionary intrigues,
incomplete armaments, inadequate
means of communication&mdash;all these reasons
would compel the Russian Government to be
an impotent spectator of Serbia's undoing. The
same confidence reigned in the German and
Austrian capitals as regards, not the French
army, but the spirit prevailing among Government
circles in Paris.</p>

<p>At present [added the Ambassador] feeling
runs so high in Vienna that all calm reflection
goes by the board. Moreover, in seeking to
annihilate Serbia's military power, the Austro-Hungarian
Cabinet is pursuing a policy of
personal revenge. It cannot realize the mistakes
that it made during the Balkan War, or remain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
satisfied with the partial successes then
gained with our aid&mdash;successes that, whatever
judgment may be passed upon them, were certainly
diplomatic victories. All that Count
Berchtold sees to-day is Serbia's insolence and
the criticism he has had to endure even in Austria.
By this bold stroke, very unexpected
from a man of his stamp, he hopes to turn the
criticism into applause.</p>

<p>The Ambassador held that Berlin had false
ideas as to the course that the Tsar's Government
would adopt. The latter would find itself
forced into drawing the sword, in order to
maintain its prestige in the Slav world. Its inaction,
in face of Austria's entry into the field,
would be equivalent to suicide. Signor Bollati
also gave me to understand that a widespread
conflict would not be popular in Italy. The
Italian people had no concern with the overthrow
of the Russian power, which was Austria's
enemy; it wished to devote all its attention
to other problems, more absorbing from
its own point of view.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Vienna
welcomes
war on
Serbia.</div>

<p>The blindness of the Austrian Cabinet with
regard to Russian intervention has been proved
by the correspondence, since published, of the
French and British representatives at Vienna.
The Viennese populace was beside itself with
joy at the announcement of an expedition
against Serbia, which, it felt sure, would be a
mere military parade. Not for a single night
were Count Berchtold's slumbers disturbed by
the vision of the Russian peril. He is, indeed,
at all times a buoyant soul, who can happily
mingle the distractions of a life of pleasure
with the heavy responsibilities of power. His
unvarying confidence was shared by the German
Ambassador, his most trusted mentor.
We can hardly suppose that the Austrian
Minister shut his eyes altogether to the possibility
of a struggle with the Slav world. Having<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
Germany as his partner, however, he determined,
with the self-possession of a fearless
gambler, to proceed with the game.</p>

<p>At Berlin, the theory that Russia was incapable
of facing a conflict reigned supreme,
not only in the official world and in society,
but among all the manufacturers who made a
specialty of war material.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Berlin
believes
Russia
weak.</div>

<p>Herr Krupp von Bohlen, who was more entitled
to give an opinion than any other of
this class, declared on July 28 that the Russian
artillery was neither efficient nor complete,
while that of the German army had
never before been so superior to all its rivals.
It would be madness on Russia's part, he
inferred, to take the field against Germany
under these conditions.</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>The foreign diplomatic corps was kept in
more or less profound ignorance as to the
<i>pourparlers</i> carried on since the 24th by the
Imperial Foreign Office with the Triple Entente
Cabinets. Nevertheless, to the diplomats
who were continually going over to the Wilhelmstrasse
for news, the crisis was set forth
in a light very favourable to Austria and Germany,
in order to influence the views of the
Governments which they represented. Herr
von Stumm, the departmental head of the
political branch, in a brief interview that I had
with him on the 26th, summed up his exposition
in these words: "Everything depends on
Russia." I should rather have thought that
everything depended on Austria, and on the
way in which she would carry out her threats
against Serbia.</p>

<p>On the following day I was received by
Herr Zimmermann, who adopted the same line<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
of argument, following it in all its bearings
from the origin of the dispute.</p>

<p>It was not at our prompting [he said], or
in accordance with our advice, that Austria
took the action that you know of towards the
Belgrade Cabinet. The answer was unsatisfactory,
and to-day Austria is mobilizing. She
can no longer draw back without risking a
collapse at home as well as a loss of influence
abroad. It is now a question of life and death
to her. She must put a stop to the unscrupulous
propaganda which, by raising revolt among
the Slav provinces of the Danube valley, is
leading towards her internal disintegration.
Finally, she must exact a signal revenge for
the assassination of the Archduke. For all
these reasons Serbia is to receive, by means of
a military expedition, a stern and salutary lesson.
An Austro-Serbian War is, therefore, impossible
to avoid.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Attempts
to limit
conflict.</div>

<p>England has asked us to join with her,
France, and Italy, in order to prevent the conflict
from spreading and a war from breaking
out between Austria and Russia. Our answer
was that we should be only too glad to help
in limiting the area of the conflagration, by
speaking in a pacific sense to Vienna and St.
Petersburg; but that we could not use our influence
with Austria to restrain her from inflicting
an exemplary punishment on Serbia.
We have promised to help and support our
Austrian allies, if any other nation should try
to hamper them in this task. We shall keep
that promise.</p>

<p>If Russia mobilizes her army, we shall at
once mobilize ours, and then there will be a
general war, a war that will set ablaze all
Central Europe and even the Balkan peninsula,
for the Rumanians, Greeks, Bulgarians,
and Turks will not be able to resist the temptation
to come in.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>As I remarked yesterday to M. Boghitchevitch
[the former Serbian Charg&eacute; d'Affaires,
who was on a flying visit to Berlin, where he
had been greatly appreciated during the Balkan
War], the best advice I can give Serbia
is that she should make no more than a show
of resistance to Austria, and should come to
terms as soon as possible, by accepting all the
conditions of the Vienna Cabinet. I added, in
speaking to him, that if a universal war broke
out and went in favor of the Triplice, Serbia
would probably cease to exist as a nation; she
would be wiped off the map of Europe. I still
hope, though, that such a widespread conflict
may be avoided, and that we shall succeed in
inducing Russia not to intervene on Serbia's
behalf. Remember that Austria is determined
to respect Serbia's integrity, once she has obtained
satisfaction.</p>

<p>I pointed out to the Under-Secretary that
the Belgrade Cabinet's reply, according to
some of my colleagues who had read it, was,
apart from a few unimportant restrictions, an
unqualified surrender to Austria's demands.
Herr Zimmermann said that he had no knowledge
of this reply (it had been handed in two
days before to the Austrian Minister at Belgrade!)
and that, in any case, there was no
longer any possibility of preventing an Austro-Hungarian
military demonstration.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Serbian
reply.</div>

<p>The Serbian document was not published by
the Berlin newspapers until the 29th. On the
previous day they all reproduced a telegram
from Vienna, stating that this apparent submission
was altogether inadequate. The
prompt concessions made by the Pasitch Cabinet,
concessions that had not been anticipated
abroad, failed to impress Germany. She persisted
in seeing only with Austria's eyes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Zimmermann's
arguments.</div>

<p>Herr Zimmermann's arguments held solely
on the hypothesis that, in the action brought<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
by Austria against Serbia, no Power had the
right to come forward as counsel for the defendant,
or to interfere in the trial at all.
This claim amounted to depriving Russia of
her historic r&ocirc;le in the Balkans. Carried to its
logical conclusion, the theory meant condemning
unheard every small State that should be
unfortunate enough to have a dispute with a
great Power. According to the principles of
the Berlin Cabinet, the great Power should be
allowed, without let or hindrance, to proceed
to the execution of its weak opponent. England,
therefore, would have had no right to
succor Belgium when the latter was invaded
by Germany, any more than Russia had a
right to protect Serbia from the Austrian
menace.</p>

<p>Russia, it was asserted at the Wilhelmstrasse,
ought to be satisfied with the assurance
that Austria would not impair the territorial
integrity of Serbia or mar her future
existence as an independent State. What a
hollow mockery such a promise would seem,
when the whole country had been ravaged by
fire and sword! Surely it was decreed that,
after this "exemplary punishment," Serbia
should become the lowly vassal of her redoubtable
neighbour, living a life that was no life,
cowed by the jealous eye of the Austrian Minister&mdash;really
the Austrian Viceroy&mdash;at Belgrade.
Had not Count Mensdorff declared to Sir Edward
Grey that before the Balkan War Serbia
was regarded as gravitating towards the Dual
Monarchy's sphere of influence? A return
to the past, to the tame deference of King
Milan, was the least that Austria would
exact.</p>

<div class="sidenote">German
opinion is
misled.</div>

<p>The version given out by the Imperial Chancellery,
besides being intended to enlighten
foreign Governments, had a further end in
view. Repeated <i>ad nauseam</i> by the Press, it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
aimed at misleading German public opinion.
From the very opening of the crisis, Herr
von Bethmann-Hollweg and his colleagues
strove, with all the ingenuity at their command,
to hoodwink their countrymen, to shuffle
the cards, to throw beforehand on Russia, in
case the situation should grow worse, the
odium of provocation and the blame for the
disaster, to represent that Power as meddling
with a police inquiry that did not concern her
in the least. This cunning man&#339;uvre resulted
in making all Germany, without distinction of
class or party, respond to her Emperor's call
at the desired moment, since she was persuaded
(as I have explained in a previous chapter)
that she was the object of a premeditated attack
by Tsarism.</p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<div class="sidenote">German
diplomacy.</div>

<p>The game of German diplomacy during these
first days of the crisis, July 24 to 28, has already
been revealed. At first inclined to
bludgeon, it soon came to take things easily,
even affecting a certain optimism, and by its
passive resistance bringing to naught all the
efforts and all the proposals of the London,
Paris, and St. <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Petersberg'">Petersburg</ins> Cabinets. To gain
time, to lengthen out negotiations, seems to
have been the task imposed upon Austria-Hungary's
accomplice in order to promote
rapid action by the Dual Monarchy, and to
face the Triple Entente with irrevocable
deeds, namely the occupation of Belgrade and
the surrender of the Serbians. But things did
not go as Berlin and Vienna had hoped, and
the determined front shown by Russia, who
in answer to the partial mobilization of Austria
mobilized her army in four southern districts,
gave food for reflection to the tacticians
of the Wilhelmstrasse. Their language and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
their frame of mind grew gentler to a singular
degree on the fifth day, July 28. It may be recalled,
in passing, that in 1913, during the
Balkan hostilities, Austria and Russia had
likewise proceeded to partial mobilizations;
yet these steps had not made them come to
blows or even brought them to the verge of
hostilities.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Kaiser
returns to
Berlin.</div>

<p>On the evening of the 26th the Emperor's
return was announced in Berlin. Why did he
come back so suddenly? I think I am justified
in saying that, at this news, the general feeling
among the actors and spectators of the drama
was one of grave anxiety. Our hearts were
heavy within us; we had a foreboding that the
decisive moment was drawing near. It was the
same at the Wilhelmstrasse. To the British
Charg&eacute; d'Affaires Herr von Zimmermann frankly
confessed his regret at this move, on which
William II had decided without consulting
any one.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, our fears at first seemed to be
unwarranted. The 28th was marked by a notable
loosening of Germany's stiff-necked attitude.
The British Ambassador, who had returned
to Berlin on the previous day, was
summoned in the evening by the Chancellor.
Herr von Bethmann-Hollweg, while rejecting
the conference proposed by Sir Edward Grey,
promised to use his good offices to induce Russia
and Austria to discuss the position in an
amicable fashion. "A war between the Great
Powers must be averted," were his closing
words.</p>

<p>It is highly probable that the Chancellor
at that time sincerely wanted to keep the
peace, and his first efforts, when he saw
the danger coming nearer and nearer, succeeded
in curbing the Emperor's impatience for
forty-eight hours. The telegram sent by William
II to the Tsar on the evening of the 28th<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
is friendly, almost reassuring: "Bearing in
mind the cordial friendship that has united
us two closely for a long time past, I am using
all my influence to make Austria arrive at a
genuine and satisfactory understanding with
Russia."</p>

<p>How are we to explain, then, the abrupt
change of tack that occurred the following day
at Berlin, or rather, at Potsdam, and the peculiar
language addressed by the Chancellor to Sir
Edward Goschen on the evening of the 29th?
In that nocturnal scene there was no longer
any question of Austria's demands on Serbia,
or even of the possibility of an Austro-Russian
war. The centre of gravity was suddenly
shifted, and at a single stride the danger passed
from the southeast of Europe to the northwest.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Will England
be
neutral?</div>

<p>What is it that Herr von Bethmann-Hollweg
wants to know at once, as he comes
straight from the council held at Potsdam under
the presidency of the Emperor? Whether
Great Britain would consent to remain neutral
in a European war, provided that Germany
agreed to respect the territorial integrity of
France. "And what of the French colonies?"
asks the Ambassador with great presence of
mind. The Chancellor can make no promise
on this point, but he unhesitatingly declares
that Germany will respect the integrity and
neutrality of Holland. As for Belgium, France's
action will determine what operations Germany
may be forced to enter upon in that
country; but when the war is over, Belgium
will lose no territory, unless she ranges herself
on the side of Germany's foes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A bargain
proposed.</div>

<p>Such was the shameful bargain proposed to
England, at a time when none of the negotiators
had dared to speak in plain terms of a
European war or even to offer a glimpse of that
terrifying vision. This interview was the immediate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
result of the decisive step taken by
German diplomacy on the same day at St.
Petersburg. The step in question has been
made known to us through the diplomatic
documents which have been printed by the
orders of the belligerent Governments, and all
of which concur in their account of this painful
episode. Twice on that day did M. Sazonoff
receive a visit from the German Ambassador,
who came to make a demand wrapped up in
threats.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Germany's
demands
on Russia.</div>

<p>Count de Pourtal&egrave;s insisted on Russia
contenting herself with the promise, guaranteed
by Germany, that Austria-Hungary
would not impair the integrity of Serbia. M.
Sazonoff refused to countenance the war on
this condition. Serbia, he felt, would become
a vassal of Austria, and a revolution would
break out in Russia. Count de Pourtal&egrave;s then
backed his request with the warning that, unless
Russia desisted from her military preparations,
Germany would mobilize. A German
mobilization, he said, would mean war. The
results of the second interview, which took
place at two o'clock in the morning, were as
negative as those of the first, notwithstanding
a last effort, a final suggestion by M. Sazonoff
to stave off the crisis. His giving in to Germany's
brutal dictation would have been an
avowal that Russia was impotent.</p>

<p>To the Emperor William, who had resumed
the conduct of affairs since the morning of the
27th&mdash;the Emperor William, itching to cut the
knot, driven on by his Staff and his generals&mdash;to
him and no other must we trace the responsibility
for this insolent move which made
war inevitable. "The heads of the army insisted,"
was all that Herr von Jagow would
vouchsafe a little later to M. Cambon by way
of explanation. The Chancellor, and with him
the Foreign Secretary and Under-Secretary,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
associated themselves with these hazardous
tactics, from sheer inability to secure the adoption
of less hasty and violent methods. If they
believed that this summary breaking off of
negotiations would meet with success, they
were as grievously mistaken as Count de Pourtal&egrave;s,
whose reports utterly misled them as to
the sacrifices that Russia was prepared to make
for Serbia.</p>

<p>At all events this upright man, when he
realized the appalling effects of his blunder,
gave free play to his emotion. Such sensitiveness
is rare indeed in a German, and redounds
entirely to his credit.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Russian
military
development.</div>

<div class="sidenote">French
military
situation.</div>

<p>But the Emperor and his council of generals&mdash;what
was their state of soul at this critical
moment? Perhaps this riddle will never be
wholly solved. From the military point of
view, which in their eyes claimed first attention,
they must <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'thave'">have</ins> rejoiced at M. Sazonoff's
answer, for never again would they find such
a golden opportunity for vanquishing Russia
and making an end of her rivalry. In 1917
the reorganization of her army would have
been complete, her artillery would have been at
full strength, and a new network of strategic
railways would have enabled her to let loose
upon the two Germanic empires a vast flood
of fighting men drawn from the inexhaustible
reservoir of her population. The struggle with
the colossus of the North, despite the vaunted
technical superiority of the German army,
would in all likelihood have ended in the triumph
of overwhelming might. In the France
of 1917, again, the three years' term of service
would have begun to produce its full results,
and her first-line troops would have been both
more numerous and better trained than at
present.</p>

<p>On the other hand, William II could cherish
no false hopes as to the consequences of this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
second pressure that he was bringing to bear
on St. Petersburg. Had it succeeded in 1914
as in 1909, the encounter between Germany and
the great Slav Empire would only have been
put off to a later day, instead of being finally
shelved. How could the Tsar or the Russian
people have forgiven the Kaiser for humbling
them once more? If they had pocketed the
affront in silence, it would only have been in
order to bide their time for revenge, and they
would have chosen the moment when Russia,
in possession of all her resources, could have
entered upon the struggle with every chance of
winning.</p>

<div class="sidenote">William
II and
Russia.</div>

<p>Here an objection may be raised. The German
Emperor, some may hold, fancying that
the weight of his sword in the scale would
induce the Tsar to shrink from action, had
foreseen the anger of the Slav nation at its
sovereign's timorous scruples, and looked forward
to revolutionary outbreaks which would
cripple the Government for years to come and
make it unable to think of war, if indeed they
did not sweep the Romanoffs from the throne.
I would answer that this Machiavellian scheme
could never have entered the head of such a
ruler as William II, with his deep sense of
monarchial solidarity, and his instinctive horror
of anarchist outrages and of revolution.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Kaiser
eager to
act.</div>

<p>No: the Emperor, together with the military
authorities whose advice he took, wished
to profit by a juncture which he had awaited
with longing, and which fickle Fortune might
never again offer to his ambition. Everything
proves it, down to his feverish haste, as soon as
M. Sazonoff's reply was conveyed to him, to
learn the intentions of England, and to suggest,
on that very day, a bargain that might
purchase her neutrality. This is why Herr von
Bethmann-Hollweg received orders to summon
the British Ambassador on the night of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
29th. The Emperor could not wait until the
following morning, so eager was he to act. Is
this impatience the mark of one who was the
victim of a concerted surprise? If he had not
wanted war, would he not have tried to resume
negotiations with Russia on a basis more in
keeping with her dignity as a Great Power,
however heavy a blow it was to his own pride
that he had failed to intimidate her?</p>


<h3>VII</h3>

<p>The abortive efforts to overawe St. Petersburg
and the offers made to the British Ambassador,
as if Great Britain's inaction could
be sold to the highest bidder, brought results
that were not hard to foresee.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sir
Edward
Grey's
telegram.</div>

<p>In London, Sir Edward Grey's indignation
found immediate vent in the following passage
of his telegram of July 30 to Sir Edward
Goschen: "It would be a disgrace for us to
make this bargain with Germany at the expense
of France&mdash;a disgrace from which the good
name of this country would never recover. The
Chancellor also in effect asks us to bargain
away whatever obligation or interest we have
as regards the neutrality of Belgium. We could
not entertain that bargain either."</p>

<p>Through the brazen overtures of Herr von
Bethmann-Hollweg, however, the British Cabinet
henceforth came to occupy itself, before all
things, with the fate allotted to our country by
the Imperial Government in the war that it
was preparing. In order to tear off the mask
from German statesmanship, the surest method
was to ask it a straightforward question. On
July 31, Sir Edward Grey, following the example
of the Gladstone Ministry of 1870, inquired
both of Germany and France whether
they would respect the neutrality of Belgium.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
At the same time he gave Belgium to understand
that Britain counted on her doing her
utmost to maintain her neutrality.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Neutrality
of
Belgium.</div>

<p>The answer of the Republican Government
was frank and unhesitating. It was resolved
to respect Belgian neutrality, and would only
act otherwise if the violation of that neutrality
by some other Power forced it to do so in self-defence.</p>

<p>The Belgian Government, for its part,
hastened to assure the British Minister at
Brussels of its determination to resist with
might and main should its territory be invaded.</p>

<p>At Berlin, however, the Foreign Secretary
eluded Sir Edward Goschen's questions. He
said that he must consult the Emperor and the
Chancellor. In his opinion, any answer would
entail the risk, in the event of war, of partly
divulging the plan of campaign. It seemed
doubtful to him, therefore, whether he would
be able to give a reply. This way of speaking
was perfectly clear in its ambiguity. It did
not puzzle Sir Edward Grey for a moment. On
the following day he declared to the German
Ambassador that the reply of the German Government
was a matter of very great regret.
Belgian neutrality, he pointed out, was highly
important in British eyes, and if Belgium was
attacked, it would be difficult to restrain public
feeling in his country.</p>

<p>On the same day, August 1, in accordance
with instructions from my Government, I read
to the Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs (at
the same time giving him a copy) a dispatch
drafted beforehand and addressed to the Belgian
Ministers attached to the Powers that had
guaranteed our neutrality. This dispatch affirmed
that Belgium, having observed, with
scrupulous fidelity, the duties imposed on her
as a neutral State by the treaties of April 19,
1839, would manifest an unshaken purpose in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
fulfilling them; and that she had every hope,
since the friendly intentions of the Powers towards
her had been so often professed, of seeing
her territory secure from all assault, if
hostilities should arise near her frontiers. The
Belgian Government added that it had nevertheless
taken all the necessary steps for maintaining
its neutrality, but that, in so doing, it
had not been actuated by a desire to take part
in an armed struggle among the Powers, or
by a feeling of distrust towards any one of
them.</p>

<p>Herr Zimmermann listened without a word
of comment to my reading of this dispatch,
which expressed the loyal confidence of my
Government in Germany's goodwill. He merely
took note of my communication. His silence
did not surprise me, for I had just learnt of
Herr von Jagow's evasive reply to the British
Government concerning Belgium; but it bore
out all my misgivings. His constrained smile,
by the way, told me quite as much as his refusal
to speak.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Russia
and
Germany
hasten
preparations.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Austria
mobilizes.</div>

<p>From the 30th, Russia and Germany&mdash;as an
inevitable sequel to the conversations of the
29th&mdash;went forward actively with their military
preparations. What was the exact nature
of these preludes to the German mobilization?
It was impossible to gain any precise notion at
Berlin. The capital was rife with various
rumors that augured ill for the future. We
heard tell of regiments moving from the northern
provinces towards the Rhine. We learnt
that reservists had been instructed to keep
themselves in readiness for marching orders.
At the same time, postal communication with
Belgium and France had been cut off. At the
Wilhelmstrasse, the position was described to
me as follows: "Austria will reply to Russia's
partial mobilization with a general mobilization
of her army. It is to be feared that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
Russia will then mobilize her entire forces,
which will compel Germany to do the same."
As it turned out, a general mobilization was
indeed proclaimed in Austria on the night of
the 30th.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the peace <i>pourparlers</i> went on
between Vienna and St. Petersburg on the 30th
and 31st, although on the latter date Russia,
as Berlin expected, in answer both to the Austrian
and the German preparations, had mobilized
her entire forces. Even on the 31st these
discussions seemed to have some chance of attaining
their object. Austria was now more
accurately gauging the peril into which her
own blind self-confidence and the counsels of
her ally were leading her, and was pausing on
the brink of the abyss. The Vienna Cabinet
even consented to talk over the gist of its Note
to Serbia, and M. Sazonoff at once sent an encouraging
reply.</p>

<p>It was desirable, he stated, that representatives
of all the Great Powers should confer
in London under the direction of the British
Government.</p>

<p>Was a faint glimmer of peace, after all,
dawning above the horizon? Would an understanding
be reached, at the eleventh hour,
among the only States really concerned with
the Serbian question? We had reckoned without
our host. The German Emperor willed
otherwise. Suddenly, at the instance of the
General Staff, and after a meeting of the Federal
Council, as prescribed by the constitution,
he issued the decree of <i>Kriegsgefahrzustand</i>
(Imminence-of-War). This is the first phase
of a general mobilization&mdash;a sort of martial
law, substituting the military for the civil authorities
as regards the public services (means
of communication, post, telegraphs, and telephones).</p>

<p>This momentous decision was revealed to us<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
on the 31st by a special edition of the <i>Berliner
Lokalanzeiger</i>, distributed at every street
corner. The announcement ran as follows:</p>

<div class='center'>
<span class="smcap">Russia Wants War!</span><br />
</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"From official sources we have just received
(at 2 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>) the following report, pregnant with
consequences:</p>

<p>"'The German Ambassador at St. Petersburg
sends us word to-day that a general mobilization
of the Russian Army and Navy had
previously been ordered. That is why His
Majesty the Emperor William has decreed an
Imminence-of-War. His Majesty will take up
his residence in Berlin to-day.'</p>

<p>"Imminence-of-War is the immediate prelude
to a general mobilization, in answer to the
menace that already hangs over Germany to-day,
owing to the step taken by the Tsar."</p></div>

<div class="sidenote">The
Kaiser's
ultimatum
to Russia.</div>

<p>As a drowning man catches at a straw, those
who in Berlin saw themselves, with horror,
faced by an impending catastrophe, clutched
at a final hope. The German general mobilization
had not yet been ordered. Who knew
whether, at the last moment, some happy inspiration
from the British Cabinet, that most
stalwart champion of peace, might cause the
weapons to drop from the hands that were
about to wield them? Once more, however, the
Emperor, by his swift moves, shattered this
fond illusion. On the 31st, at seven o'clock in
the evening, he dispatched to the Russian
Government a summons to demobilize both
on its Austrian and on its German frontiers.
An interval of twelve hours was given for
a reply.</p>

<p>It was obvious that Russia, who had refused
two days before to cease from her military
preparations, would not accept the German<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
ultimatum, worded as it was in so dictatorial
a form and rendered still more insulting by
the briefness of the interval granted. As, however,
no answer had come from St. Petersburg
by the afternoon of August 1st, Herren von
Jagow and Zimmermann (so the latter informed
me) rushed to the Chancellor and the
Emperor, in order to request that the decree
for a general mobilization might at least be
held over until the following day. They supported
their plea by urging that the telegraphic
communication with St. Petersburg had presumably
been cut, and that this would explain
the silence of the Tsar. Perhaps they still
hoped against hope for a conciliatory proposal
from Russia. This was the last flicker of their
dying pacifism, or the last awakening of their
conscience. Their efforts could make no headway
against the stubborn opposition of the
War Minister and the army chiefs, who represented
to the Emperor the dangers of a twenty-four
hours' delay.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Germany
mobilizes.</div>

<p>The order for a mobilization of the army
and navy was signed at five o'clock in the
afternoon and was at once given out to the
public by a special edition of the <i>Lokalanzeiger</i>.
The mobilization was to begin on August 2nd.
On the 1st, at ten minutes past seven in the
evening, Germany's declaration of war was forwarded
to Russia.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pretexts
given in
Germany.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Heroism
of France.</div>

<p>As all the world knows, the Berlin Cabinet
had to resort to wild pretexts, such as the committing
of acts of hostility (so the military
authorities alleged) by French aviators on
Imperial soil, in order to find motives, two days
later, for its declaration of war on France. Although
Germany tried to lay the blame for
the catastrophe at Russia's door, it was in
reality her western <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'neighbor'">neighbour</ins> that she wished
to attack and annihilate first. On this point
there can be no possible doubt to-day. "Poor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
France!" said the Berlin newspapers, with
feigned compassion. They acknowledged that
the conduct of the French Government throughout
the crisis had been irreproachable, and that
it had worked without respite for the maintenance
of peace. While her leaders fulfilled
this noble duty to mankind, France was offering
the world an impressive sight&mdash;the sight of
a nation looking calmly and without fear at a
growing peril that she had done nothing to conjure
up, and, regarding her word as her bond,
determined in cold blood to follow the destiny
of her ally on the field of battle. At the same
time she offered to Germany, who had foolishly
counted on her being torn by internal troubles
and political feuds, the vision of her children
closely linked together in an unconquerable resolve&mdash;the
resolve to beat back an iniquitous
assault upon their country. Nor was this the
only surprise that she held in store. With the
stone wall of her resistance, she was soon to
change the whole character of the struggle,
and to wreck the calculations of German
strategy.</p>

<p>No one had laboured with more energy and
skill to quench the flames lit by Austria and
her ally than the representative of the Republic
at Berlin.</p>

<p>"Don't you think M. Cambon's attitude
has been admirable?" remarked the British
Ambassador to me, in the train that was
whirling us far away from the German capital
on August 6th. "Throughout these terrible
days nothing has been able to affect his coolness,
his presence of mind, and his insight."
I cannot express my own admiration better
than by repeating this verdict of so capable a
diplomat as Sir Edward Goschen, who himself
took a most active part in the vain attempt
of the Triple Entente to save Europe from
calamity.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>


<h3>VIII</h3>

<div class="sidenote">Berlin
enthusiastic.</div>

<p>The Berlin population had followed the various
phases of the crisis with tremendous interest,
but with no outward show of patriotic
fervour. Those fine summer days passed as
tranquilly as usual. Only in the evenings did
some hundreds of youths march along the highways
of the central districts, soberly singing
national anthems, and dispersing after a few
cries of "Hoch!" outside the Austro-Hungarian
and Italian Embassies and the Chancellor's
mansion.</p>

<p>On August 2nd I watched the animation
of the Sunday crowd that thronged the broad
avenue of the Kurf&uuml;rstendamm. It read attentively
the special editions of the newspapers,
and then each went off to enjoy his or
her favourite pastime&mdash;games of tennis for the
young men and maidens, long bouts of drinking
in the beer-gardens, for the more sedate
citizens with their families. When the Imperial
motor-car flashed like a streak of
lightning down Unter den Linden, it was hailed
with loud, but by no means frantic, cheers. It
needed the outcries of the Press against Russia
as the instigator of the war, the misleading
speeches of the Emperor and the Chancellor,
and the wily publications of the Government,
to kindle a patriotism rather slow to take
fire. Towards the close of my stay, feeling
displayed itself chiefly by jeers at the unfortunate
Russians who were returning post-haste to
their native country, and blackguardly behaviour
towards the staff of the Tsar's Ambassador
as he was leaving Berlin.</p>

<div class="sidenote">German
people
deluded.</div>

<p>That the mass of the German people, unaware
of Russia's peaceful intentions, should
have been easily deluded, is no matter for astonishment.
The upper classes, however, those<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
of more enlightened intellect, cannot have been
duped by the official falsehoods. They knew as
well as we do that it was greatly to the advantage
of the Tsar's Government not to provoke
a conflict. In fact, this question is hardly
worth discussing. Once more we must repeat
that, in the plans of William II and his generals,
the Serbian affair was a snare spread for
the Northern Empire before the growth of its
military power should have made it an invincible
foe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Uncertainty
regarding
Britain.</div>

<div class="sidenote">England's
attitude.</div>

<p>There is no gainsaying that uncertainty as to
Britain's intervention was one of the factors
that encouraged Germany. We often asked
ourselves anxiously at Berlin whether Germany's
hand would not have been stayed altogether
if the British Government had formally
declared that it would not hold aloof from the
war. We even hoped, for a brief moment, that
Sir Edward Grey would destroy the illusions
on which the German people loved to batten.
The British Foreign Secretary did indeed observe
to Prince Lichnowsky on July 29th that
the Austro-Serbian issue might become so great
as to involve all European interests, and that
he did not wish the Ambassador to be misled
by the friendly tone of their conversations into
thinking that Britain would stand aside. If at
the beginning she had openly taken her stand
by the side of her Allies, she might, to be sure,
have checked the fatal march of events. This,
at any rate, is the most widespread view, for
a maritime war certainly did not enter into the
calculations of the Emperor and Admiral von
Tirpitz, while it was the nightmare of the German
commercial world. In my opinion, however,
an outspoken threat from England on the
29th, a sudden roar of the British lion, would
not have made William II draw back. The
memory of Agadir still rankled in the proud
Germanic soul. The Emperor would have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
risked losing all prestige in the eyes of a certain
element among his subjects if at the bidding
of the Anglo-Saxon he had refused to go
further, and had thus played into the hands of
those who charged him with conducting a
policy of mere bluff and intimidation. "Germany
barks but does not bite" was a current
saying abroad, and this naturally tended to exasperate
her. An ominous warning from the
lips of Sir Edward Grey would only have
served to precipitate the onslaught of the Kaiser's
armies, in order that the intervention of
the British fleet might have no influence on the
result of the campaign, the rapid and decisive
campaign planned at Berlin.</p>

<div class="sidenote">British
opinion.</div>

<p>We know, moreover, from the telegrams and
speeches of the British Foreign Minister, how
carefully he had to reckon with public feeling
among his countrymen in general and among
the majority in Parliament. A war in the Balkans
did not concern the British nation, and
the strife between Teuton and Slav left it cold.
It did not begin to be properly roused until it
grasped the reality of the danger to France's
very existence, and it did not respond warmly
to the eloquent appeals of Mr. Asquith and
Sir Edward Grey until the day when it knew
that the Germans were at the gates of Li&egrave;ge,
where they threatened both Paris and Antwerp&mdash;Antwerp,
"that pistol pointed at the
heart of England."</p>

<div class='center'><br /><br /><small>The National Review, June, 1916.</small></div>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>With the failure of diplomatic efforts to prevent
war as a result of the deliberate intention
of Germany to bring about the conflict, the
great German war machine was put in motion.
It was anticipated by the General Staff that
the passage across Belgium would be effected
without difficulty and with the acquiescence
of King and people.</p>

<p>How wrong was this judgment is one of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
curious facts of history. The Germans discovered
this error when their armies presented
themselves before the strong fortress of <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Liege'">Li&egrave;ge</ins>,
the first fortified place in their path. Its capture
was necessary for the successful passage
of the German troops.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Importance

<p>It was captured, but at a cost in time and in
their arrangement of plans which were a
great element in the great thrust&mdash;back at the

<h2>THE DEFENCE OF <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'LIEGE'">LI&Egrave;GE</ins></h2>

<h3>CHARLES BRONNE</h3>


<div class="sidenote">Germany
invades
Belgium.</div>

<p>On Sunday, August 2nd, while the news
was going round that a train had entered
Luxembourg with German forces,
the German Minister at Brussels delivered an
ultimatum to Belgium demanding the free
passage through our territory of the German
armies. The following day, Monday, the Belgian
Government replied that the nation was
determined to defend its neutrality. The same
night the German advanced posts entered our
territory. Tuesday morning they were before
Vis&eacute;, at Warsage, at Dolhain, and at Stavelot.
The bridges of Vis&eacute; and Argenteau and the
tunnels of Troisponts and Nas-Prou&eacute; were
blown up.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Atrocities
begin.</div>

<p>From this day the atrocities committed by
the pioneers of German "Kultur" began at Vis&eacute;
with fire and the massacre of inhabitants. On
Thursday, they were to continue at Warsage
and Berneau. On Wednesday, August 5th, the
investment of Li&egrave;ge began, the bombardment
being specially directed to the north-west sector
which comprises the forts of Evegn&eacute;e, Barchon,
and Fl&eacute;ron. In the afternoon the attack extended
as far as the fort of Chaudfontaine.
The region attacked by the foe was thus that
between the Meuse and the Vesdre, the beautiful
country of Herve, where cornfields are followed
by vineyards, where meadowland encroaches
on the sides of narrow but picturesque
valleys, where small but thick woods conceal
the number of the assailants. It was found<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
necessary to destroy some prosperous little
farms, several country houses, and pretty villas.
This was but a prelude to the devastation
brought by the soldiers of the Kaiser.</p>



<p>The enemy was in force. Later it was known
that around Li&egrave;ge were the 10th Prussian Army
Corps from Aix-la-Chapelle on the way to Vis&eacute;,
the 7th Corps, which had passed through the
Herve country, the 8th, which had entered
through Stavelot, and also a brigade of the 11th
Corps, making up a total of about 130,000 men.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Forts of
Li&egrave;ge.</div>

<p>To resist these forces, General Leman had
forts more than twenty-four years old and
30,000 men: the 3rd division of the army increased
by the 15th mixed brigade, <i>i.e.</i>, the 9th,
11th, 12th, and 14th of the line, a part of the
2nd Lancers, a battalion of the 1st Carabineers,
and the Divisional Artillery.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Thursday, August 6th, was rich in moving
incidents.</p>

<p>While the enemy were in force before Barchon,
in a night attack, an attempt was made
on General Leman. The story has been variously
told. Here is the true version.</p>

<div class="sidenote">German
spies.</div>

<p>The enemy's spies, so numerous in Li&egrave;ge, had
been able to give the most exact information
regarding the installation of the General Staff
in the Rue Sainte Foy. They were quite aware
that for a week the defender of Li&egrave;ge had only
been taking two or three hours' rest in his
office, so as to be more easily in telephonic communication
with the forts and garrison. These
offices in the Rue Sainte Foy were very badly
situated, at the extreme end of the northern
quarter, and were defended only by a few
gendarmes. General Leman had been warned,
however, and the King himself had at last persuaded
him to take some precautions against a
possible attempt. He had finally given way to
this advice, and a rudimentary structure, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
a sure one, fitted with electric light and telephone,
was being set up under the railway tunnel
near the Palais station.</p>

<p>This was, then, the last night the General
would pass at Rue Sainte Foy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">General
Leman in
danger.</div>

<p>Towards half-past four in the morning a
body of a hundred men descended from the
heights of Tawes. Whence did they come?
How had they been able to penetrate into the
town? Some have said that they dressed in
Li&egrave;ge itself. In reality, they represented themselves
to the advanced posts of the fort of
Pontisse as being Englishmen come to the aid
of Li&egrave;ge, and asked to be conducted to the General
Staff. They were soldiers of a Hanoverian
regiment, and bore upon their sleeves a blue
band with the word "Gibraltar." This contributed
in no small degree to cause them to
be taken for British sharpshooters. They were
preceded by a spy who had put on the Belgian
uniform of the 11th of the line and who seemed
to know the town very well. At Thier-&agrave;-Li&egrave;ge,
they stopped a moment to drink at a wine-shop
and then went on. They were more than a
hundred in number and were preceded by two
officers. A detachment of Garde Civique, posted
at the gas factory of the Rue des Bayards, did
not consider it their duty to interfere. A few
individuals accompanied the troop, crying
"Vive les Anglais." A few passers-by, better-aware
of the situation, protested. The troop
continued its imperturbable march. The officers
smiled. Thus they arrived at Rue Sainte Foy
where, as we have said, the offices of the General
Staff of General Leman were installed.</p>

<p>A German officer asked of the sentinel on the
door an interview with General Leman. The
officers of the latter, who now appeared, understood
the ruse at once, and drew their revolvers.
Shots were exchanged. One of the
officers, Major Charles Marchand, a non-commissioned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
officer of gendarmes, and several
gendarmes were killed. The Germans attempted
to enter the offices, of which the door
had been closed. They fired through the windows,
and even attempted to attack the house
by scaling the neighbouring walls. General
Leman, who was working, ran out on hearing
the first shots. He was unarmed. He demanded
a revolver. Captain Lebbe, his aide-de-camp,
refused to allow him to expose himself uselessly,
and begged him to keep himself for the
defence of Li&egrave;ge. He even used some violence
to his chief, and pushed him towards the low
door which separated the house from the courtyard
of a neighbouring cannon foundry. With
the help of another officer, the captain placed
his General in safety. While this was happening,
the alarm had been given, and the Germans,
seeing that their attempt to possess
themselves of the person of General Leman had
failed, retired. The guard, which comprised
some fifty men, fired repeatedly on the retreating
party. Some fifty Germans, including a
standard-bearer and a drummer, were killed.
Others were made prisoners.</p>

<div class="sidenote">General
Leman in
Fort
Loncin.</div>

<p>The General retired to the citadel of Sainte
Walburge, and later to the fort of Loncin.
From there he followed the efforts of the enemy
attacking anew the north-east and south-east
sectors. The environs of Fort Boncelles are
as difficult to defend as those of the Barchon-Evegn&eacute;e-Fl&eacute;ron
front. There is first the discovered
part which surrounds what remains of
the unfortunate village of Boncelles, which the
Belgians themselves were forced to destroy to
free their field of fire, but for the rest, there
are only woods, that of Plainevaux, which
reaches to the Ourthe, Neuville, and Vecqu&eacute;e
woods, that of B&eacute;gnac, which continues Saint
Lambert wood as far as Trooz and the Meuse.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Belgian
troops
fight
heroically.</div>

<p>Every place here swarmed with Germans,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
40,000 at least, an army corps which had spent
a day and a night in fortifying themselves, and
had been able to direct their artillery towards
Plainevaux, to the north of Neuville, and upon
the heights of Ramet. Thirty thousand men at
least would have been needed to defend this
gap and less than 15,000 were available. A
similar attack was delivered at the same time
between the Meuse and the Vesdre. On both
sides miracles of heroism were performed, but
the enemy poured on irresistibly. They were
able to pass, on the one side, Val Saint Lambert,
on the other, between Barchon and the
Meuse, between Evegn&eacute;e and Fl&eacute;ron. Fighting
took place well into the night, the enemy being
repulsed at Boncelles twice. The following
morning I saw pieces of German corpses. The
Belgian artillery had made a real carnage, and
no smaller number of victims fell in the bayonet
charges. The 9th and the Carabineers, who
had fought the day before at Barchon, were
present here.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Retreat
ordered.</div>

<p>In the other sector, the soldiers of the 12th
of the line particularly behaved like heroes.
The battle began towards two o'clock in the
morning at R&eacute;tinne where, after prodigies of
valour and a great slaughter of the enemy, the
Belgian troops were forced to retire. The
struggle continued at Saine and at Queue du
Bois. Here Lieutenant F. Bronne and forty of
his men fell while covering the retreat. In
spite of such devotion and of a bravery that
will not be denied, the enemy passed through.
Why? Some troops surrendered with their
officers, who were afterwards set free upon
parole at Li&egrave;ge. But this was only a very
small exception, and it was under the pressure
of an enemy four times as numerous that the
3rd division succumbed after three days of repeated
fighting, during which the soldiers were
compelled to make forced marches from one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
sector to another, and stop the rest of the time
in the trenches fighting. The enemy's losses
were 5,000 killed and 30,000 wounded.</p>

<p>General Leman considered that he had obtained
from his troops the maximum effort of
which they were capable and ordered a retreat.
It was executed in good order, and the enemy
had suffered so severely that they did not dream
of pursuit. They contented themselves with
pushing forward as far as the plateau of Saint-Tilman
(close to Boncelles) and that of
Robermont (behind Fl&eacute;ron) some cannons of
15, which had bombarded the town the first
time on Thursday, August 6th, at four o'clock
in the morning. No German troops, except
some 200 men who entered as prisoners, penetrated
into the town on this day.</p>

<p>Although this retreat left behind a few men
with several guns, it may be said to have been
effected in good order. I was able to see that
for myself in passing through with the troops,
from the fifth limit of the Saint Trond route,
near Fort Loncin, up to the centre of the town.
The auto in which I was seated was able to
pass easily.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Refugees.</div>

<p>The terrified population from Bressoux began
to arrive. There were people half-dressed, but
who carried some object which to them seemed
the most precious, sometimes a simple portrait
of a loved one. Others drove cattle before
them. The men carried children, while women
followed painfully loaded with household
goods. Mixed up with them were the Garde
Civique. It had just been assembled and informed
that it was disbanded, and a certain
number of them had told the inhabitants that
the Prussians were coming, and that there was
nothing better to do than for everyone to bolt
himself in. The cannon had thundered all
night. The citizens of Li&egrave;ge had found in their
letter-boxes a warning from the burgomaster<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
concerning the behaviour of the inhabitants in
case of the town being occupied by the enemy.
This urgent notice, distributed the night before
between 9 and 11 p.m., foreshadowed an imminent
occupation. The hasty flight of the
people of Bressoux stopped when they had
crossed the Meuse; but as the bombardment recommenced
towards noon, fright again seized
on the population. The bombardment lasted
till two. Some thirty shells fell on different
parts of the town.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Bridge of
Arches
destroyed.</div>

<p>At half-past twelve a dull noise was heard as
far as the furthest fort; it was the old Bridge
of Arches which gave way, towards the left
bank. The engineers had just blown it up. It
seemed wiser to destroy the bridge at Val
B&eacute;noit, which left the Germans railway communication.
But no one thought of this; or
rather, orders to that effect were not given by
the higher authorities. This was afterwards
to cause the degradation to the ranks of the
chief officer of engineers who was responsible
for this unpardonable lapse.</p>

<p>The second bombardment lasted till two
o'clock. Several projectiles now fell upon the
citadel, where everything was in readiness to
set fire to the provisions and munitions which
remained there along with some unserviceable
cannon, generally used in the training of the
Garde Civique. By 10 a.m. the citadel had
been evacuated, only very few persons remaining,
among them a major, who hastily hoisted
the white flag.</p>

<div class="sidenote">German
envoys in
Li&egrave;ge.</div>

<p>Burgomaster Kleyer awaited developments at
the Town Hall. At half-past three, he received
envoys, who demanded the surrender of the
town and forts. Put into communication with
General Leman, who was all the time at Loncin
with his Staff, he informed him that if the forts
persisted in their resistance, the town would
be bombarded a third time. General Leman<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
replied that the threat was an idle one, that it
would be a cruel massacre, but that the higher
interests of Belgium compelled him to impose
this sacrifice on the town of Li&egrave;ge.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Bombardment
of
Li&egrave;ge.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Gloomy
aspect
of the
town.</div>

<p>At 9 p.m. fresh shells fell on different parts
of the city and caused more damage if not more
victims. This bombardment lasted till 2 a.m.
It recommenced at intervals of half-an-hour,
and caused two fires, one in Rue de Hanque,
and the other in Rue de la Commune. After
midday, the streets were deserted and all dwelling
houses closed. In the afternoon a convoy
of Germans taken prisoners were seen to pass
along the boulevards, and were then shut up
in the Royal Athen&aelig;um. Then there was an
interminable defile of autos and carts conveying
both German and Belgian wounded, especially
the former, those who came from Boncelles
more particularly. Bodies of stragglers
re-entered Li&egrave;ge slowly, ignorant of what had
happened, as they were either untouched by the
order to retire, or had been forgotten in the
advanced posts or in the trenches. They were
very tired and hardly had the courage to accelerate
their pace, except when the few passers-by
explained the position in a couple of words.
The aspect of the town was very gloomy, and
the only places where any animation was to be
seen were around Guillemins station, where
trains full of fugitives were leaving for Brussels,
the West quarter, towards which the last
of the retiring companies were marching, and
the North, where many were still ignorant of
this movement.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Germans
enter
Li&egrave;ge.</div>

<p>On Friday, August 7th, at 3 a.m., the bombardment
of Li&egrave;ge began again, chiefly directed
against the citadel, where only a few soldiers
now remained. These evacuated the place after
setting fire to some provisions they were unable
to carry off. The population passed
through hours of anguish, which were destined<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
not to be the last. Everybody took refuge in
the cellars. Some people lived there for several
days in fear that a shell might fall upon their
house. On this Friday the Germans penetrated
into the town at five o'clock in the morning by
the different bridges which had remained intact.
They came in through Jupille and Bois
de Breux chiefly. They seemed tired and, above
all, hungry. Leaving detachments in the Place
de Bavi&egrave;re and near the bridges, they successively
occupied the Provincial Palace and the
citadel.</p>

<p>Count Lammsdorf, Chief of the Staff of the
10th Corps, Commander of the Army of the
Meuse, arrested Burgomaster Kleyer at the
Town Hall, and conducted him to the citadel,
where he at first made him a rather reassuring
communication as to the fate of the town....
He then spoke anew and said that he understood
all the forts would surrender, in default
of which the bombardment would recommence.
M. Kleyer vainly protested against a measure
so contrary to the laws both of war and of
humanity. He was simply authorized to pass
through the German lines with a safe conduct,
to discuss the matter with General Leman, or
even with the King himself.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Burgomaster's
task.</div>

<p>This task of the burgomaster of Li&egrave;ge was a
heavy one, and terrible was the expectant attitude
of the German authorities. Later, some
people have discussed the attitude he should
have taken up and conceived the nature of
what should have been his reply; they would
have desired words of defiance on his lips and
an immediate answer.</p>

<p>He lacked courage for this, and who will dare
to-day to blame him for the immense anxiety
he felt on hearing of the horrible fate with
which his beloved town and his unhappy fellow-citizens
were threatened?</p>

<p>He gathered together at the Town Hall several<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
communal and provincial deputies, some
deputies and senators. The general opinion
at the beginning of the discussion was that it
was necessary to obtain the surrender of the
forts. Someone pointed out that there was
not much likelihood of getting this decision
from General Leman, who had already pronounced
himself upon that question, and
thought it would be necessary to continue the
work heroically begun of arresting the progress
of the invader, and that the forts, all intact,
would powerfully contribute to that end.</p>

<p>It was finally decided to approach General
Leman again with a message which was entrusted
to the burgomaster, the Bishop of Li&egrave;ge,
and M. Gaston Gr&eacute;goire, permanent deputy.
These gentlemen repaired to the citadel in
search of the promised safe conduct. They were
met there, according to the demand of Count
Lammsdorf, by some prominent Li&egrave;ge citizens,
to whom he had expressed his desire to explain
the situation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hostages
to the
Germans.</div>

<p>At the moment the three delegates were about
to depart on their mission, with a good faith
upon which it would be foolish to insist, the
German commander declared that all the persons
present were detained as hostages. He
gave as a specious pretext for this violation
of right that some German soldiers had been
killed by civilians in some neighbouring villages,
and that the hostages would enable the
Germans to guard against the repetition of
such acts, the more so as they were prepared
to make a striking example at the beginning
of the campaign.</p>

<p>All the Li&egrave;ge citizens who had entered the
citadel on this day were kept there till the next
day, Saturday. Moreover, the following persons
were retained as responsible hostages for
three days: 1. Mgr. Rutien, Bishop of Li&egrave;ge;
2. M. Kleyer, Burgomaster of Li&egrave;ge; 3. M.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
Gr&eacute;goire, Permanent Deputy; 4. M. Armand
Flechet, Senator; 5. Senator Van Zuylen; 6.
Senator Edouard Peltzer; 7. Senator Colleaux;
8. Deputy De Ponthi&egrave;re; 9. Deputy Van Hoegaerden;
10. M. Falloise, Alderman.</p>

<p>The hostages were shut up in damp case-mates,
palliasses were given them for the night
and, as food, the first day each one had half a
loaf and some water. The burgomaster and the
bishop were, however, allowed to go about their
duties after they had given their parole to remain
at the disposal of the German military
authorities.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Last
train for
Brussels.</div>

<p>The same day at 9 a.m. the last train left
Li&egrave;ge for Brussels with numbers of fugitives.
The number of persons who abandoned Li&egrave;ge
and its suburbs may be calculated at some five
thousand. From this moment and for several
days Li&egrave;ge was absolutely cut off from the rest
of the world, all communications having been
cut.</p>

<p>On Saturday, August 8th, while the Germans
were methodically organising the occupation
of Li&egrave;ge, Burgomaster Kleyer was authorised
to wait upon the King, in order to discuss the
surrender of the forts. Furnished with a safe
conduct and accompanied by a German officer,
he reached Waremme early in the afternoon,
and placed himself in communication with the
General Staff. The King was consulted, and
the reply brought back to Li&egrave;ge was the one
the mayor had foreseen.</p>

<p>The same day saw the appearance of the following
order of the day addressed to the
soldiers of the army of Li&egrave;ge:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Our comrades of the 3rd Army Division
and of the 15th mixed brigade are about to re-enter
our lines, after having defended, like
heroes, the fortified position of Li&egrave;ge.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The King

<p>"Attacked by forces four times as numerous,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
they have repulsed all assaults. None of the
forts have been taken; the town of Li&egrave;ge is
always in our power. Standards and a number
of prisoners are the trophies of these combats.
In the name of the Nation I salute you, officers
and soldiers of the 3rd Army Division and the
15th mixed brigade.</p>

<p>"You have done your duty, done honour to
our arms, shown the enemy what it costs to attack
unjustly a peaceable people, but one who
wields in its just cause an invincible weapon.
The Fatherland has the right to be proud of
you.</p>

<p>"Soldiers of the Belgian Army, do not forget
that you are in the van of immense armies in
this gigantic struggle, and that you await but
the arrival of our brothers-in-arms in order to
march to victory. The whole world has its eyes
fixed upon you. Show it by the vigour of your
blows that you mean to live free and independent.</p>

<p>"France, that noble country which has
throughout history been associated with just
and generous causes, is hurrying to our aid
and her armies will enter our territory.</p>

<p>"In your name I address them a fraternal
salute.</p>

<div class='sig'><span class="smcap">Albert.</span>"<br />
</div></div>

<div class="sidenote">German
precautions.</div>

<div class="sidenote">
Barricades
constructed.</div>

<p>On this day the Germans, who were not yet
sure as to the intentions of the Belgian field
army, and who feared a possible offensive on
the part of the French advanced guards, put
Li&egrave;ge in a state of defence. Moreover, they
distrusted the civilian population, and fortified
themselves in the town itself. They placed machine
guns at the head of the bridges, and upon
one of them, Boverie, which they feared might
be blown up, or might be bombarded by the
forts, they placed a curtained recess in which
they shut up several citizens. They caused
the soldiers to occupy Quai des P&ecirc;cheurs, Quai<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
l'Industrie, and the houses in proximity to the
bridge, after clearing out the occupants. They
placed bags of earth in the windows, behind
which were installed machine guns. In the
arteries leading to La Hesbaye and La Campine,
and in the streets of the latter, they
erected barricades, and installed themselves in
the riverside houses. These labours continued
during several days on the heights of Saint
Nicholas and Hollogne, while the soldiers of
the 10th Corps installed themselves on the
plateau of Cointe, the General Staff having
taken possession there of a convent, although
this had been transformed into a hospital. In
the town, the German troops, delayed for a
short time by the necessity of carrying off their
dead, shifting their wounded, and of taking a
much-needed rest, entered in large numbers.
They occupied the different stations, that of
Ans on the Herbignon plateau being the last
one where they established themselves.</p>

<p>On Sunday, September 6th, there were at
Li&egrave;ge more than 100,000 Germans. On this
day, at one o'clock in the afternoon, the hostages
were given their unconditional liberty.
On the same date, in the neighbourhood of
Landen, the King, accompanied by the General
Staff, reviewed the valiant and now reconstituted
3rd Division, reconstituted in spite of
the heavy losses in officers suffered by certain
regiments. General Leman received from M.
Schollaert, President of the Belgian Chamber,
the following telegram: "With a heart overflowing
with enthusiasm and patriotic pride,
I acclaim the glorious defender of Li&egrave;ge."</p>

<div class="sidenote">
Praise for

<div class="sidenote">President

<p>With reference to the defence of Li&egrave;ge, letters,
despatches, and addresses of felicitation
were received at Brussels from the Presidents
of the French Chamber and the French Senate,
from the Paris Municipal Council, and other
French municipalities, words of friendship and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
encouragement were pronounced later in the
British Parliament, while the King of the Belgians
received the congratulations of King
George, the Tsar, and the President of the
French Republic. Finally, M. Poincar&eacute; sent
him the most envied of distinctions, the military
medal. The resistance of Li&egrave;ge had everywhere
aroused grateful enthusiasm, for the
days, and even the hours gained from the invader
were now of inestimable value. But
while the twelve forts were not yet to harass,
as they could, the progress of the enemy, Li&egrave;ge,
whose hatred of the Prussian is ingrained, was
to pay dearly for the resistance it had made,
and its heart was to suffer cruelly over the
vexations of which it was to be the object, while
awaiting pillage and burning.</p>

<p>Here we enter upon a new period, which cannot,
however, be separated from the siege of
Li&egrave;ge, for at this time the forts still held out.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
twelve
forts.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Forts
on the
banks
of the
Meuse.</div>

<p>The forts still held out, but the resistance of
their garrisons had to be heroic. The defences
crumbled quite rapidly. We should not be surprised
at this, but should rather remember that
these forts were more than twenty years old.
Their construction began in 1889, and their
armament, though modified later in certain details,
was not capable of resisting the heavy
artillery of the Germans. Li&egrave;ge was defended
by twelve forts, large and small. The most
important works were Barchon, Fl&eacute;ron, Boncelles,
Fl&eacute;malle, Loncin, and Pontisse. These
forts possessed five large cupolas and three or
four small ones. They were armed with two
guns of 15 centimetres, four of 12, two howitzers
of 21, and three or four guns of 5'7, ten
more of 5'7 flanking the ditches. The little
forts counted upon four large and three or four
small cupolas. They were armed with two
pieces of 15, two of 12, a howitzer of 21, three
or four guns, without cupola, of 5'7, and of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
seven or eight commanding the ditches. The
forts are arranged around Li&egrave;ge in the following
order:&mdash;On the left bank of the Meuse:
Fl&eacute;malle, Hollogne, Loncin, Lantin, and Pontisse.
On the right bank, between the Meuse
and the Vesdre: Barchon, Evegn&eacute;e, and Fl&eacute;ron.
Between the Vesdre and the Ourthe: Chaudfontaine
and Embourg. Between the Ourthe
and the Meuse: Boncelles. The forts are four
kilometres apart, except Fl&eacute;malle-Boncelles
and Embourg-Pontisse, which are six kilometres
apart, while Chaudfontaine and Embourg
are only two kilometres from one another.
The forts are eight kilometres from the
limits of the town. The forts of Hollogne,
Loncin, Lantin, and Liers are in grassy country.
Boncelles is nearly completely surrounded
by woods; Embourg and Chaudfontaine dominate
the deep and winding valleys of the
Ourthe and the Vesdre. Pontisse, Fl&eacute;malle,
and Barchon, commanding the Meuse, are on
broken ground. This last-named fort, with
Evegn&eacute;e and Fl&eacute;ron, holds the most important
strategic position in the Herve country, facing
the German frontier, in a land cut up by
meadows planted with trees and by little
woods, traversed by many vales, not very deep,
but winding.</p>

<div class="sidenote">War
conditions
changed.</div>

<p>It is known that in the Brialmont project
the intervening spaces were to be defended and
fortified with siege artillery. To tell the truth,
the eminent military engineer, in the pamphlets
where he set out the project, only allowed for
a small mobile garrison, but he confessed later
that the difficulties which he knew he would
meet with in the Belgian Parliament over the
credits for the fortifications made him underestimate
the number of men required. Besides
which, the conditions of war have been greatly
modified during the twenty-five years which
have passed, owing to the increased power of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
siege guns. So that it may be laid down that
80,000, if not 100,000, men were needed to properly
defend the entrenched camp of Li&egrave;ge.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Troops
in the
forts.</div>

<p>As for the forts, they were each occupied by
a battery of artillery (250 men) and three companies
(120 men), a total of 370 men. About
4,500 artillerymen for the twelve forts.</p>

<p>General Leman was shut up in Loncin, one
of the chief forts, which commanded the road
towards Waremme and Brussels. He had sent
away all his General Staff with the division,
in spite of the supplications of his officers, who
begged to be allowed to share his fate. He
continued to direct the longest resistance possible.
The enemy was anxious to cut all the
communications between the forts, but soldiers
volunteered for carrying messages to the different
commanders. Several succeeded, but many
were killed, for the investment became steadily
tightened. Indeed, certain gaps, where the
ground was most broken, could not be swept
by the guns from the forts, and, under cover
of the night, troops ensconced themselves there
comfortably. Moreover, the Germans, having
received reinforcements and heavy artillery,
undertook the siege systematically, first of
Barchon, which it was unable to take by storm
any more than Boncelles, but which it subjected
to a formidable deluge of shells. Barchon
could only reply haphazard to heavy guns the
position of which it could not tell. It was, indeed,
deprived of its observation posts, and
was in the position of a blind man desperately
parrying the blows of an adversary who could
see where to strike.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fort
Barchon
taken.</div>

<p>The struggle was not for long, and the fort,
reduced to impotence, left a wide breach
through which the invader scrambled. Through
there he could also introduce his heavy siege
guns, howitzers of 28, and even pieces of 42
cms.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Forty-two
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'centimeter'">centimetre</ins>
guns.</div>

<p>The enemy then followed a tactic which was
to succeed rapidly. He attacked the different
fortifications in a reverse way. Thus Loncin,
Lantin, Liers, and Pontisse were bombarded
by batteries placed in the citadel itself and to
which the Belgians could not reply without
shelling the town and doing frightful damage.
A battery was also placed in a bend of ground
up Rue Naniot, under the "Tomb," where some
of those who fell in 1830 are buried, but it was
discovered and had to be withdrawn. Forts
Boncelles and Embourg were attacked by guns
placed on the hill at Tilff, a pretty village,
which would have been completely destroyed
had the firing been responded to. Finally,
along the line of the plateau of Herve, no
longer dominated by Barchon and Fl&eacute;ron, now
destroyed, the enemy was able to bring into
the very centre of the town four of those
howitzers of 42 cms. which were later to bombard
Namur, Maubeuge, and Antwerp.</p>

<p>The following are the dates on which the different
forts succumbed: Barchon and Evegn&eacute;e
fell on August 9th. Right from the 5th they
had not ceased to be the object of continual attacks.
They had valiantly resisted repeated
assaults and field artillery. The heavy pieces
poured in a hurricane of fire.</p>

<p>Pontisse, which had so usefully barred the
passage of the enemy below Vis&eacute;, did not give
way till the 12th. On the 13th Embourg surrendered
after a twenty-six hours' bombardment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Forts
yield one
by one.</div>

<p>The same day saw the fall of Chaudfontaine
and Nameche, where two accidents happened
worthy of being related. A shell burst on a
cupola gun as it was finishing its movement
after being loaded. The whole gun was shattered
and ten men were wounded. A little
while after, a shell entered the fort through
the embrasure and set fire to the powder magazine.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
One hundred and ten artillerymen were
terribly burned, fifty dying upon the spot. The
14th saw the fall of Boncelles, Liers, and
Fl&eacute;ron. Boncelles from the 5th had offered an
admirable resistance. Commandant Lefert had
been wounded on the 8th, when 200 Germans,
presenting themselves to surrender, treacherously
fired upon him. Suffering greatly, he
none the less went on directing the defence
until his officers met together in a kind of
council of war, and had him taken away in an
ambulance. The unfortunate man was seized
by a fever and became delirious. Boncelles
was bombarded unceasingly for a whole day
and the following morning. It was nearly destroyed,
and may be considered as the fort which
was the centre of the worst carnage of German
soldiers. The enormous heaps of dead buried
around it bear witness to the fact. Liers was
put out of action by guns installed at Sainte
Walburge.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Loncin
and
Lantin
fall.</div>

<p>To get the better of the obstinate resistance
of Fl&eacute;ron (Commandant Mozin), the Germans
united twenty guns by an electric battery and
fired them all off at the same time upon the
fort, which trembled in its massive foundations.
No one can have an idea of how demoralising
this rain of projectiles was. On the 15th, Loncin
and Lantin fell, the defenders firing until
they were overcome by asphyxia. On the 16th,
it was the turn of Fl&eacute;malle, and on the 18th,
of Hollogne.</p>

<p>We know that it was at Loncin, which
dominated the roads of La Hesbaye, where
General Leman was shut up. Commandant
Naessens and Lieutenant Monard had the honour
of defending the fort under the General's
eyes. Electrified by the presence of the governor
of the fortress, the soldiers of Loncin wrote
with their blood the most heroic page of the
heroic defence of Li&egrave;ge. Commandant Naessens<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
modestly narrated the story when he had
been wounded and transported to the military
hospital of Saint Laurent. General Leman has
also <i>r&eacute;sum&eacute;d</i> the different phases of the attack,
while a prisoner at Magdeburg. We will listen
to his clear and crisp recital.</p>

<div class="sidenote">General
Leman's
story.</div>

<p>He distinguishes four periods during the
bombardment. The first commenced on August
14th at 4.15 p.m. The shell fire, directed with
great exactitude, lasted two hours without interruption.
After a break of half-an-hour,
some 21-centimetre guns opened fire. All night,
at intervals of ten minutes, they rained shells
upon the fort, causing it considerable damage.
The escarpment was damaged, the protecting
walls of the left flank battery destroyed, and
the shutters of the windows pierced. Another
unfavourable circumstance was that all the
places of the escarpment where shelter could
be obtained were full of smoke from the shells
which had burst either in the protecting wall
or in the ditches. The deleterious gases rendered
it impossible to stand in the covered
places, and forced the General to assemble the
garrison in the interior and in the gallery.
Even in these refuges the stupefying effects of
the gases allowed themselves to be felt, and
weakened the fighting value of the garrison.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Horrors
of the
bombardments.</div>

<p>The third period of bombardment began on
the 15th at 5.30 a.m. and continued until two
o'clock in the afternoon. The projectiles
caused fearful havoc. The vault of the commanding
post, where General Leman was present
with his two adjutants, was subjected to
furious shocks, and the fort trembled to its
foundations. Towards two o'clock, a lull occurred
in the firing, and the general took advantage
of it to inspect the fort. He found
part of it completely in ruins.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Currents
of poisonous
gas.</div>

<p>The fourth period is described as follows:
"It was two o'clock when the bombardment<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
recommenced with a violence of which no idea
can be given. It seemed to us as if the German
batteries were firing salvoes. When the
large shells fell we heard the hissing of the air,
which gradually increased into a roar like a
furious hurricane, and which finished by a sudden
noise of thunder. At a certain moment of
this formidable bombardment, I wished to
reach the commanding post in order to see what
was happening, but at the end of a few paces
in the gallery I was knocked down by a shock
of violent air and fell face forward. I got up
and wished to continue my way, but I was held
back by a current of poisonous air which invaded
the whole space. It was a mixture of the
gas from the exploded powder and of the smoke
of a fire which had started in the rooms of the
troops where furniture and bedding were kept.</p>

<p>"We were thus driven back to the place
whence we had come, but the air had become
unbreathable. We were near to being asphyxiated
when my adjutant, Major Collard, had
the idea of taking off the top of the shutter,
which gave us a little air. I was, however,
obsessed by the idea of placing part of the
garrison in safety, and I told my comrade I
desired to reach the counter-escarpment. I
managed to pass the gap and reach the ditch,
which I crossed. What was my amazement
when I perceived that the fort was blown up,
and that the front was strewn with ruins, forming
a quay reaching from the escarpment to
the counter-escarpment. Some soldiers were
running to and fro upon it. I took them for
Belgian gendarmes and called to them. But
I was being suffocated, giddiness seized upon
me, and I fell to the ground. When I came to,
I found myself in the midst of my comrades,
who tried to come to my aid. Among them was
a German major, who gave me a glass of water
to drink. As I learnt afterwards, it was then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
about 6.30 p.m. I was placed in an ambulance

<div class="sidenote">Surrender
of Namur.</div>

<p>Following the capture of Li&egrave;ge the German
armies made rapid progress through Belgium.
After several sharp engagements with Belgian
troops, which resisted with heroic tenacity, the
Germans on August 19 took Louvain, and
then began the deliberate system of atrocities
which horrified the civilized world. The most
valuable parts of the city, including many
beautiful and important edifices, were burned,
citizens were killed and tortured, and the utmost
brutality was practiced, under the excuse
that German troops had been fired upon by
citizens of the town. On August 17 Brussels
had been abandoned by the Belgian Government
which withdrew to Antwerp. The former
city was surrendered without resistance. In
the meantime the French had hurried their
armies to assist the Belgian forces and, joined
by the available troops of the English Expeditionary
Force, they encountered the Germans
at Charleroi. On August 23 the great
fortress of Namur was surrendered under the
fire of the heavy German artillery, and on the
following day, the Allied armies were defeated
at Charleroi, and began the Great Retreat toward
Paris which was to continue to the banks
of the Marne. The French armies were under
the command of General Joffre, while Sir John
French commanded the British Expeditionary
Force. In the following narrative General
French describes the heroic performances of
his gallant troops during the terrible ordeal.</p>

<h2>THE GREAT RETREAT</h2>

<h3>SIR JOHN FRENCH</h3>


<p>The transport of the troops from England
both by sea and by rail was effected in the
best order and without a check. Each
unit arrived at its destination in this country
well within the scheduled time.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Disposition
of
British
forces.</div>

<p>The concentration was practically complete
on the evening of Friday, September 21st, and
I was able to make dispositions to move the
force during Saturday, the 22d, to positions I
considered most favorable from which to commence
operations which the French Commander
in Chief, General Joffre, requested me
to undertake in pursuance of his plans in prosecution
of the campaign.</p>

<p>The line taken up extended along the line of
the canal from Cond&eacute; on the west, through
Mons and Binche on the east. This line was
taken up as follows:</p>

<p>From Cond&eacute; to Mons inclusive was assigned
to the Second Corps, and to the right of the
Second Corps from Mons the First Corps was
posted. The Fifth Cavalry Brigade was placed
at Binche.</p>

<p>In the absence of my Third Army Corps I
desired to keep the cavalry division as much
as possible as a reserve to act on my outer
flank, or move in support of any threatened
part of the line. The forward reconnoissance
was intrusted to Brigadier General
Sir Philip Chetwode with the Fifth Cavalry
Brigade, but I directed General Allenby to
send forward a few squadrons to assist in
this work.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Advance
on Soignies.</div>

<p>During the 22d and 23d these advanced
squadrons did some excellent work, some of
them penetrating as far as Soignies, and several
encounters took place in which our troops
showed to great advantage.</p>

<p>2. At 6 A. M. on August 23, I assembled the
commanders of the First and Second Corps and
cavalry division at a point close to the position
and explained the general situation of the
Allies, and what I understood to be General
Joffre's plan. I discussed with them at some
length the immediate situation in front of us.</p>

<p>From information I received from French
Headquarters I understood that little more
than one, or at most two, of the enemy's army
corps, with perhaps one cavalry division, were
in front of my position; and I was aware of
no attempted outflanking movement by the
enemy. I was confirmed in this opinion by the
fact that my patrols encountered no undue opposition
in their reconnoitring operations. The
observations of my aeroplanes seemed also to
bear out this estimate.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Attack
on Mons
line.</div>

<p>About 3 P. M. on Sunday, the 23d, reports
began coming in to the effect that the enemy
was commencing an attack on the Mons line,
apparently in some strength, but that the right
of the position from Mons and Bray was being
particularly threatened.</p>

<p>The commander of the First Corps had
pushed his flank back to some high ground
south of Bray, and the Fifth Cavalry Brigade
evacuated Binche, moving slightly south; the
enemy thereupon occupied Binche.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
Germans
gain
passages
of the
Sambre.</div>

<p>The right of the Third Division, under General
Hamilton, was at Mons, which formed a
somewhat dangerous salient; and I directed
the commander of the Second Corps to be careful
not to keep the troops on this salient too
long, but, if threatened seriously, to draw back
the centre behind Mons. This was done before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
dark. In the meantime, about 5 P. M., I received
a most unexpected message from General
Joffre by telegraph, telling me that at least
three German corps, viz., a reserve corps, the
Fourth Corps and the Ninth Corps, were moving
on my position in front, and that the Second
Corps was engaged in a turning movement
from the direction of Tournay. He also informed
me that the two reserve French divisions
and the Fifth French Army on my right
were retiring, the Germans having on the previous
day gained possession of the passages of
the Sambre between Charleroi and Namur.</p>

<p>3. In view of the possibility of my being
driven from the Mons position, I had previously
ordered a position in rear to be reconnoitred.
This position rested on the fortress of Maubeuge
on the right and extended west to Jenlain,
southeast of Valenciennes, on the left.
The position was reported difficult to hold, because
standing crops and buildings made the
siting of trenches very difficult and limited the
field of fire in many important localities. It
nevertheless afforded a few good artillery
positions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">British
retire to
Maubeuge
position.</div>

<p>When the news of the retirement of the
French and the heavy German threatening on
my front reached me, I endeavored to confirm
it by aeroplane reconnoissance; and as a result
of this I determined to effect a retirement to
the Maubeuge position at daybreak on the 24th.</p>

<p>A certain amount of fighting continued
along the whole line throughout the night and
at daybreak on the 24th the Second Division
from the neighborhood of Harmignies made a
powerful demonstration as if to retake Binche.
This was supported by the artillery of both the
First and Second Divisions, while the First
Division took up a supporting position in the
neighborhood of Peissant. Under cover of this
demonstration the Second Corps retired on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
line Dour-Quarouble-Frameries. The Third Division
on the right of the corps suffered considerable
loss in this operation from the enemy,
who had retaken Mons.</p>

<p>The Second Corps halted on this line, where
they partially intrenched themselves, enabling
Sir Douglas Haig with the First Corps gradually
to withdraw to the new position; and he
effected this without much further loss, reaching
the line Bavai-Maubeuge about 7 P. M.
Toward midday the enemy appeared to be directing
his principal effort against our left.</p>

<p>I had previously ordered General Allenby
with the cavalry to act vigorously in advance
of my left front and endeavor to take the
pressure off.</p>

<div class="sidenote">General
Allenby
supports
Fifth
Division.</div>

<p>About 7:30 A. M. General Allenby received
a message from Sir Charles Fergusson, commanding
the Fifth Division, saying that he was
very hard pressed and in urgent need of support.
On receipt of this message General
Allenby drew in the cavalry and endeavored to
bring direct support to the Fifth Division.</p>

<p>During the course of this operation General
De Lisle, of the Second Cavalry Brigade,
thought he saw a good opportunity to paralyze
the further advance of the enemy's infantry by
making a mounted attack on his flank. He
formed up and advanced for this purpose, but
was held up by wire about 500 yards from his
objective, and the Ninth Lancers and the Eighteenth
Hussars suffered severely in the retirement
of the brigade.</p>

<p>The Nineteenth Infantry Brigade, which had
been guarding the line of communications, was
brought up by rail to Valenciennes on the 22d
and 23d. On the morning of the 24th they were
moved out to a position south of Quarouble to
support the left flank of the Second Corps.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sir
Horace
Smith-Dorrien
suffers
great
losses.</div>

<p>With the assistance of the cavalry Sir Horace
Smith-Dorrien was enabled to effect his retreat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
to a new position; although, having two corps
of the enemy on his front and one threatening
his flank, he suffered great losses in doing so.</p>

<p>At nightfall the position was occupied by the
Second Corps to the west of Bavai, the First
Corps to the right. The right was protected
by the fortress of Maubeuge, the left by the
Nineteenth Brigade in position between Jenlain
and Bry, and the cavalry on the outer
flank.</p>

<p>4. The French were still retiring, and I had
no support except such as was afforded by the
Fortress of Maubeuge; and the determined attempts
of the enemy to get round my left flank
assured me that it was his intention to hem
me against that place and surround me. I felt
that not a moment must be lost in retiring to
another position.</p>

<p>I had every reason to believe that the enemy's
forces were somewhat exhausted and I knew
that they had suffered heavy losses. I hoped,
therefore, that his pursuit would not be
too vigorous to prevent me effecting my
object.</p>

<p>The operation, however, was full of danger
and difficulty, not only owing to the very superior
force in my front, but also to the exhaustion
of the troops.</p>

<p>The retirement was recommenced in the early
morning of the 25th to a position in the neighborhood
of Le Cateau, and rearguards were
ordered to be clear of the Maubeuge-Bavai-Eth
Road by 5:30 A. M.</p>

<div class="sidenote">General
Allenby
covers
west flank.</div>

<p>Two cavalry brigades, with the divisional
cavalry of the Second Corps, covered the movement
of the Second Corps. The remainder of
the cavalry division, with the Nineteenth Brigade,
the whole under the command of General
Allenby, covered the west flank.</p>

<p>The Fourth Division commenced its detrainment
at Le Cateau on Sunday, the 23d, and by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
the morning of the 25th eleven battalions and
a brigade of artillery with divisional staff were
available for service.</p>

<p>I ordered General Snow to move out to take
up a position with his right south of Solesmes,
his left resting on the Cambrai-Le Cateau
Road south of La Chaprie. In this position the
division rendered great help to the effective retirement
of the Second and First Corps to the
new position.</p>

<p>Although the troops had been ordered to occupy
the Cambrai-Le Cateau-Landrecies position,
and the ground had, during the 25th, been
partially prepared and intrenched, I had grave
doubts&mdash;owing to the information I had received
as to the accumulating strength of the
enemy against me&mdash;as to the wisdom of standing
there to fight.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Retirement
of French
troops on
right.</div>

<p>Having regard to the continued retirement
of the French on my right, my exposed left
flank, the tendency of the enemy's western
corps (II.) to envelop me, and, more than all,
the exhausted condition of the troops, I determined
to make a great effort to continue the
retreat till I could put some substantial obstacle,
such as the Somme or the Oise, between
my troops and the enemy, and afford the former
some opportunity of rest and reorganization.
Orders were, therefore, sent to the corps commanders
to continue their retreat as soon as
they possibly could toward the general line
Vermand-St. Quentin-Ribemont.</p>

<p>The cavalry, under General Allenby, were
ordered to cover the retirement.</p>

<p>Throughout the 25th and far into the evening,
the First Corps continued its march on Landrecies,
following the road along the eastern
border of the For&ecirc;t de Mormal, and arrived at
Landrecies about 10 o'clock. I had intended
that the corps should come further west so as
to fill up the gap between Le Cateau and Landrecies,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
but the men were exhausted and could
not get further in without rest.</p>

<div class="sidenote">British

Landrecies.</div>

<div class="sidenote">French

<p>The enemy, however, would not allow them
this rest, and about 9:30 P. M. a report was
received that the Fourth Guards Brigade in
Landrecies was heavily attacked by troops of
the Ninth German Army Corps, who were coming
through the forest on the north of the town.
This brigade fought most gallantly, and caused
the enemy to suffer tremendous loss in issuing
from the forest into the narrow streets of the
town. This loss has been estimated from reliable
sources at from 700 to 1,000. At the same
time information reached me from Sir Douglas
Haig that his First Division was also heavily
engaged south and east of Maroilles. I sent
urgent messages to the commander of the two
French reserve divisions on my right to come
up to the assistance of the First Corps, which
they eventually did. Partly owing to this assistance,
but mainly to the skillful manner in
which Sir Douglas Haig extricated his corps
from an exceptionally difficult position in the
darkness of the night, they were able at dawn
to resume their march south toward Wassigny
on Guise.</p>

<p>By about 6 P. M. the Second Corps had got
into position with their right on Le Cateau,
their left in the neighborhood of Caudry, and
the line of defense was continued thence by
the Fourth Division toward Seranvillers, the
left being thrown back.</p>

<p>During the fighting on the 24th and 25th the
cavalry became a good deal scattered, but by
the early morning of the 26th General Allenby
had succeeded in concentrating two brigades to
the south of Cambrai.</p>

<p>The Fourth Division was placed under the
orders of the general officer commanding the
Second Army Corps.</p>

<p>On the 24th the French cavalry corps, consisting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
of three divisions under General Sord&ecirc;t,
had been in billets north of Avesnes. On my
way back from Bavai, which was my "Poste
de Commandement" during the fighting of the
23d and 24th, I visited General Sord&ecirc;t, and
earnestly requested his co-operation and support.
He promised to obtain sanction from
his army commander to act on my left flank,
but said that his horses were too tired to move
before the next day. Although he rendered me
valuable assistance later on in the course of the
retirement, he was unable for the reasons given
to afford me any support on the most critical
day of all, viz., the 26th.</p>

<div class="sidenote">British
Second
Corps and
Fourth
Division
heavily
attacked.</div>

<p>At daybreak it became apparent that the
enemy was throwing the bulk of his strength
against the left of the position occupied by the
Second Corps and the Fourth Division.</p>

<p>At this time the guns of four German army
corps were in position against them, and Sir
Horace Smith-Dorrien reported to me that he
judged it impossible to continue his retirement
at daybreak (as ordered) in face of such an
attack.</p>

<p>I sent him orders to use his utmost endeavors
to break off the action and retire at the earliest
possible moment, as it was impossible for me
to send him any support, the First Corps being
at the moment incapable of movement.</p>

<p>The French cavalry corps, under General
Sord&ecirc;t, was coming up on our left rear early
in the morning, and I sent an urgent message
to him to do his utmost to come up and support
the retirement of my left flank; but owing to
the fatigue of his horses he found himself unable
to intervene in any way.</p>

<p>There had been no time to intrench the position
properly, but the troops showed a magnificent
front to the terrible fire which confronted
them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">British
artillery

<p>The artillery, although outmatched by at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
least four to one, made a splendid fight, and inflicted
heavy losses on their opponents.</p>

<p>At length it became apparent that, if complete
annihilation was to be avoided, a retirement
must be attempted; and the order was
given to commence it about 3:30 P. M. The
movement was covered with the most devoted
intrepidity and determination by the artillery,
which had itself suffered heavily, and the fine
work done by the cavalry in the further retreat
from the position assisted materially in the
final completion of this most difficult and
dangerous operation.</p>

<p>Fortunately the enemy had himself suffered
too heavily to engage in an energetic pursuit.</p>

<div class="sidenote">General
Sir
Horace
Smith-Dorrien

<p>I cannot close the brief account of this glorious
stand of the British troops without putting
on record my deep appreciation of the valuable
services rendered by General Sir Horace Smith-Dorrien.</p>

<p>I say without hesitation that the saving of
the left wing of the army under my command
on the morning of the 26th August could never
have been accomplished unless a commander
of rare and unusual coolness, intrepidity, and
determination had been present to personally
conduct the operation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">British

<p>The retreat was continued far into the night
of the 26th and through the 27th and 28th, on
which date the troops halted on the line Noyon-Chauny-La
F&egrave;re, having then thrown off the
weight of the enemy's pursuit.</p>

<p>On the 27th and 28th August I was much
indebted to General Sord&ecirc;t and the French
cavalry division which he commands for
materially assisting my retirement and successfully
driving back some of the enemy on
Cambrai.</p>

<p>General D'Amade also, with the Sixty-first
and Sixty-second French Reserve Divisions,
moved down from the neighborhood of Arras<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
on the enemy's right flank and took much pressure
off the rear of the British forces located
there.</p>

<div class="sidenote">End of

<p>This closes the period covering the heavy
fighting which commenced at Mons on Sunday
afternoon, 23d August, and which really constituted
a four days' battle.</p>

<p>At this point, therefore, I propose to close
the present dispatch.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Serious

<p>I deeply deplore the very serious losses which
the British forces have suffered in this great
battle; but they were inevitable in view of the
fact that the British Army&mdash;only two days
after a concentration by rail&mdash;was called upon
to withstand a vigorous attack of five German
army corps.</p>

<p>It is impossible for me to speak too highly
of the skill evinced by the two general officers
commanding army corps; the self-sacrificing
and devoted exertions of their staffs; the direction
of the troops by divisional, brigade, and
regimental leaders; the command of the smaller
units by their officers; and the magnificent
fighting spirit displayed by non-commissioned
officers and men.</p>

<p>I wish particularly to bring to your Lordship's

which has been of incalculable value

remained undaunted throughout.</p>

<p>Further, by actually fighting in the air, they

<h2>THE BATTLE OF THE MARNE</h2>

<h3>SIR JOHN FRENCH</h3>


<div class='right'>
17th September, 1914.<br />
</div>

<p>My Lord: In continuation of my dispatch
of September 7, I have the honor to report
the further progress of the operations
of the forces under my command from
August 28.</p>

<p>On that evening the retirement of the force
was followed closely by two of the enemy's
cavalry columns, moving southeast from St.
Quentin.</p>

<p>The retreat in this part of the field was being
covered by the Third and Fifth Cavalry
Brigades. South of the Somme General Gough,
with the Third Cavalry Brigade, threw back
the Uhlans of the Guard with considerable loss.</p>

<div class="sidenote">General
Chetwode
routs
German
attack.</div>

<p>General Chetwode, with the Fifth Cavalry
Brigade, encountered the eastern column near
Cerizy, moving south. The brigade attacked
and routed the column, the leading German
regiment suffering very severe casualties and
being almost broken up.</p>

<p>The Seventh French Army Corps was now
in course of being railed up from the south to
the east of Amiens. On the 29th it nearly
completed its detrainment, and the French
Sixth Army got into position on my left, its
right resting on Roye.</p>

<p>The Fifth French Army was behind the line
of the Oise, between La F&egrave;re and Guise.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Vigorous
pursuit of
retreating
German
forces.</div>

<p>The pursuit of the enemy was very vigorous;
some five or six German corps were on the
Somme, facing the Fifth Army on the Oise.
At least two corps were advancing toward my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
front, and were crossing the Somme east and
west of Ham. Three or four more German
corps were opposing the Sixth French Army
on my left.</p>

<p>This was the situation at 1 o'clock on the
29th, when I received a visit from General
Joffre at my headquarters.</p>

<p>I strongly represented my position to the
French Commander in Chief, who was most
kind, cordial, and sympathetic, as he has always
been. He told me that he had directed
the Fifth French Army on the Oise to move
forward and attack the Germans on the Somme,
with a view to checking pursuit. He also told
me of the formation of the Sixth French Army
on my left flank, composed of the Seventh Army
Corps, four reserve divisions, and Sord&ecirc;t's
corps of cavalry.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Short retirement
towards
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Compiegne'">Compi&egrave;gne</ins>-Soissons.</div>

<p>I finally arranged with General Joffre to
effect a further short retirement toward the
line Compi&egrave;gne-Soissons, promising him, however,
to do my utmost to keep always within
a day's march of him.</p>

<p>In pursuance of this arrangement the British
forces retired to a position a few miles north
of the line Compi&egrave;gne-Soissons on the 29th.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Right
flank of

<p>The right flank of the Germany Army was
now reaching a point which appeared seriously
to endanger my line of communications with
Havre. I had already evacuated Amiens, into
which place a German reserve division was reported
to have moved.</p>

<p>Orders were given to change the base to St.
Nazaire, and establish an advance base at Le
Mans. This operation was well carried out by
the Inspector General of Communications.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Retirement
to
the Marne
ordered.</div>

<p>In spite of a severe defeat inflicted upon the
Guard Tenth and Guard Reserve Corps of the
German Army by the First and Third French
Corps on the right of the Fifth Army, it was
not part of General Joffre's plan to pursue this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
advantage; and a general retirement to the
line of the Marne was ordered, to which the
French forces in the more eastern theatre were
directed to conform.</p>

<p>A new Army (the Ninth) had been formed
from three corps in the south by General Joffre,
and moved into the space between the right
of the Fifth and left of the Fourth Armies.</p>

<p>While closely adhering to his strategic conception
to draw the enemy on at all points until
a favorable situation was created from
which to assume the offensive, General Joffre
found it necessary to modify from day to day
the methods by which he sought to attain this
object, owing to the development of the enemy's
plans and changes in the general situation.</p>

<p>In conformity with the movements of the
French forces, my retirement continued practically
from day to day. Although we were
not severely pressed by the enemy, rearguard
actions took place continually.</p>

<p>On the 1st September, when retiring from
the thickly wooded country to the south of
Compi&egrave;gne, the First Cavalry Brigade was
overtaken by some German cavalry. They
momentarily lost a horse artillery battery, and
several officers and men were killed and wounded.
With the help, however, of some detachments
from the Third Corps operating on their
left, they not only recovered their own guns,
but succeeded in capturing twelve of the
enemy's.</p>

<p>Similarly, to the eastward, the First Corps,
retiring south, also got into some very difficult
forest country, and a somewhat severe rearguard
action ensued at Villers-Cotterets, in
which the Fourth Guards Brigade suffered considerably.</p>

<div class="sidenote">British

Marne.</div>

<p>On September 3 the British forces were in
position south of the Marne between Lagny and
Signy-Signets. Up to this time I had been requested<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
by General Joffre to defend the passages
of the river as long as possible, and to
blow up the bridges in my front. After I had
made the necessary dispositions, and the destruction
of the bridges had been effected, I
was asked by the French Commander in Chief
to continue my retirement to a point some
twelve miles in rear of the position I then occupied,
with a view to taking up a second position
behind the Seine. This retirement was
duly carried out. In the meantime the enemy
had thrown bridges and crossed the Marne in
considerable force, and was threatening the
Allies all along the line of the British forces
and the Fifth and Ninth French Armies. Consequently
several small outpost actions took
place.</p>

<p>On Saturday, September 5, I met the French
Commander in Chief at his request, and he informed
me of his intention to take the offensive
forthwith, as he considered conditions very
favorable to success.</p>

<div class="sidenote">General
Joffre
announces

to take
offensive.</div>

<p>General Joffre announced to me his intention
of wheeling up the left flank of the Sixth Army,
pivoting on the Marne and directing it to move
on the Ourcq; cross and attack the flank of the
First German Army, which was then moving in
a southeasterly direction east of that river.</p>

<p>He requested me to effect a change of front
to my right&mdash;my left resting on the Marne and
my right on the Fifth Army&mdash;to fill the gap
between that army and the Sixth. I was then
to advance against the enemy in my front and
join in the general offensive movement.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Battle
begins
Sunday,
September
6.</div>

<p>These combined movements practically commenced
on Sunday, September 6, at sunrise;
and on that day it may be said that a great
battle opened on a front extending from
Ermenonville, which was just in front of the
left flank of the Sixth French Army, through
Lizy on the Marne, Mauperthuis, which was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
about the British centre, Courtecon, which was
on the left of the Fifth French Army, to Esternay
and Charleville, the left of the Ninth Army
under General Foch, and so along the front of
the Ninth, Fourth and Third French Armies
to a point north of the fortress of Verdun.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Battle

<p>This battle, in so far as the Sixth French
Army, the British Army, the Fifth French
Army, and the Ninth French Army were concerned,
may be said to have concluded on the
evening of September 10, by which time the
Germans had been driven back to the line Soissons-Rheims,
with a loss of thousands of prisoners,
many guns, and enormous masses of transport.</p>

<p>About September 3 the enemy appears to
have changed his plans and to have determined
to stop his advance south direct upon Paris, for
on September 4 air reconnoissances showed
that his main columns were moving in a
southeasterly direction generally east of a
line drawn through Nanteuil and Lizy on the
Ourcq.</p>

<p>On September 5 several of these columns
were observed to have crossed the Marne, while
German troops, which were observed moving
southeast up the left flank of the Ourcq on the
4th, were now reported to be halted and facing
that river. Heads of the enemy's columns were
seen crossing at Changis, La <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Ferte'">Fert&eacute;</ins>, Nogent,
Ch&acirc;teau Thierry, and Mezy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">German
columns

<p>Considerable German columns of all arms
were seen to be converging on Montmirail,
while before sunset large bivouacs of the enemy
were located in the neighborhood of Coulommiers,
south of Rebais, La Fert&eacute;-Gaucher, and
Dagny.</p>

<p>I should conceive it to have been about noon
on September 6, after the British forces had
changed their front to the right and occupied
the line Jouy-Le Chatel-Faremoutiers-Villeneuve<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
Le Comte, and the advance of the Sixth
French Army north of the Marne toward the
Ourcq became apparent, that the enemy realized
the powerful threat that was being made
against the flank of his columns moving southeast,
and began the great retreat which opened
the battle above referred to.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Position
of allies
and Germans
on September 6.</div>

<p>On the evening of September 6, therefore,
the fronts and positions of the Allied Army
were roughly as follows:</p>

<p><i>Sixth French Army.</i>&mdash;Right on the Marne at
Meux, left toward Betz.</p>

<p><i>British Forces.</i>&mdash;On the line Dagny-Coulommiers-Maison.</p>

<p><i>Fifth French Army.</i>&mdash;At Courtagon, right on
Esternay.</p>

<p><i>Conneau's Cavalry Corps.</i>&mdash;Between the
right of the British and the left of the French
Fifth Army.</p>

<p>The position of the German Army was as
follows:</p>

<p><i>Fourth Reserve and Second Corps.</i>&mdash;East of
the Ourcq and facing that river.</p>

<p><i>Ninth Cavalry Division.</i>&mdash;West of Crecy.</p>

<p><i>Second Cavalry Division.</i>&mdash;North of Coulommiers.</p>

<p><i>Fourth Corps.</i>&mdash;Rebais.</p>

<p><i>Third and Seventh Corps.</i>&mdash;Southwest of
Montmirail.</p>

<div class="sidenote">First and

<p>All these troops constituted the First German
Army, which was directed against the
French Sixth Army on the Ourcq, and the British
forces, and the left of the Fifth French
Army south of the Marne.</p>

<p>The Second German Army (IX., X., X.R.,
and Guard) was moving against the centre and
right of the Fifth French Army and the Ninth
French Army.</p>

<p>On September 7 both the Fifth and Sixth
French Armies were heavily engaged on our
flank. The Second and Fourth Reserve German<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
Corps on the Ourcq vigorously opposed the
advance of the French toward that river, but
did not prevent the Sixth Army from gaining
some headway, the Germans themselves suffering
serious losses. The French Fifth Army
threw the enemy back to the line of the Petit
Morin River after inflicting severe losses upon
them, especially about Montceaux, which was
carried at the point of the bayonet.</p>

<p>The enemy retreated before our advance,
covered by his Second and Ninth and Guard
Cavalry Divisions, which suffered severely.</p>

<p>Our cavalry acted with great vigor, especially
General De Lisle's brigade, with the Ninth
Lancers and Eighteenth Hussars.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Germans
retreat
September 8.</div>

<p>On September 8 the enemy continued his retreat
northward, and our army was successfully
engaged during the day with strong rearguards
of all arms on the Petit Morin River,
thereby materially assisting the progress of the
French armies on our right and left, against
whom the enemy was making his greatest efforts.
On both sides the enemy was thrown
back with very heavy loss. The First Army
Corps encountered stubborn resistance at La
Tr&eacute;toire, (north of Rebais.) The enemy occupied
a strong position with infantry and
guns on the northern bank of the Petit Morin
River; they were dislodged with considerable
loss. Several machine guns and many prisoners
were captured, and upward of 200 German
dead were left on the ground.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Forcing

<p>The forcing of the Petit Morin at this point
was much assisted by the cavalry and the First

<p>Later in the day a counter-attack by the
enemy was well repulsed by the First Army
Corps, a great many prisoners and some guns
again falling into our hands.</p>

<p>On this day (September 8) the Second Army
Corps encountered considerable opposition, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
drove back the enemy at all points with great
loss, making considerable captures.</p>

<p>The Third Army Corps also drove back considerable
bodies of the enemy's infantry and
made some captures.</p>

<div class="sidenote">British

<p>On September 9 the First and Second Army
Corps forced the passage of the Marne and advanced
some miles to the north of it. The Third
Corps encountered considerable opposition, as
the bridge at La Fert&eacute; was destroyed and the
enemy held the town on the opposite bank
in some strength, and thence persistently
obstructed the construction of a bridge;
so the passage was not effected until after
nightfall.</p>

<p>During the day's pursuit the enemy suffered
heavy loss in killed and wounded, some hundreds
of prisoners fell into our hands and a
battery of eight machine guns was captured
by the Second Division.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sixth

<p>On this day the Sixth French Army was
heavily engaged west of the River Ourcq. The
enemy had largely increased his force opposing
them; and very heavy fighting ensued, in which
the French were successful throughout.</p>

<p>The left of the Fifth French Army reached
the neighborhood of Ch&acirc;teau Thierry after
the most severe fighting, having driven the
enemy completely north of the river with
great loss.</p>

<p>The fighting of this army in the neighborhood
of Montmirail was very severe.</p>

strong rearguards of all arms. The First and

on the right, the Third and Fifth Cavalry
Brigades on the left, drove the enemy northward.
Thirteen guns, seven machine guns,
about 2,000 prisoners, and quantities of transport
fell into our hands. The enemy left many<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
dead on the field. On this day the French Fifth

<p>In concluding this dispatch I must call your
Lordship's special attention to the fact that
from Sunday, August 23, up to the present

to the Seine, and from the Seine to the Aisne,
the army under my command has been ceaselessly

<p>In the narratives preceding we have seen
how the English forces conducted themselves
during the Great Retreat and at the Marne.
It must be remembered, however, that they
comprised but a small proportion of the armies
opposing the Germans. The French bore the
brunt of the attack, and a French army turned
the tide of battle. Beginning with the first
days of September all other military events
were overshadowed by the Great Retreat. On
September 1 the Germans, in spite of French
and British resistance, had reached Senlis. On
September 4th Amiens was captured, and two
days later the German army entered Rheims.
In the following narrative is shown, through
the official records, how the French armies bore
themselves during the Great Retreat, the First
Battle of the Marne, and in the fighting which
marked the hurried return of the German
armies to the banks of the Aisne which they
had, with true foresight, fortified with such a
possible situation in mind.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>
<h2>HOW THE FRENCH FOUGHT</h2>

<h3>THE FRENCH OFFICIAL ACCOUNT</h3>


<p>The first month of the campaign began
with successes and finished with defeats
for the French troops. Under what circumstances
did these come about?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Two
principal
actions.</div>

<p>Our plan of concentration had foreseen the
possibility of two principal actions, one on the
right <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'betweeen'">between</ins> the Vosges and the Moselle, the
other on the left to the north of Verdun-Toul
line, this double possibility involving the eventual
variation of our transport. On August 2,
owing to the Germans passing through Belgium,
our concentration was substantially
modified by General Joffre in order that our
principal effort might be directed to the north.</p>

<p>From the first week in August it was apparent
that the length of time required for the
British Army to begin to move would delay our
action in connection with it. This delay is one
of the reasons which explain our failures at the
end of August.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mulhouse
occupied.</div>

<p>Awaiting the moment when the operations in
the north could begin, and to prepare for it by
retaining in Alsace the greatest possible number
of German forces, the General in Chief ordered
our troops to occupy Mulhouse, (M&uuml;lhousen,)
to cut the bridges of the Rhine at
Huningue and below, and then to flank the attack
of our troops, operating in Lorraine.</p>

<p>This operation was badly carried out by a
leader who was at once relieved of his command.
Our troops, after having carried Mulhouse,
lost it and were thrown back on Belfort.
The work had, therefore, to be recommenced<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
afresh, and this was done from August 14 under
a new command.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Enemy
losses.</div>

<p>Mulhouse was taken on the 19th, after a brilliant
fight at Dornach. Twenty-four guns were
captured from the enemy. On the 20th we held
the approaches to Colmar, both by the plain
and by the Vosges. The enemy had undergone
enormous losses and abandoned great stores
of shells and forage, but from this moment
what was happening in Lorraine and on our
left prevented us from carrying our successes
further, for our troops in Alsace were needed
elsewhere.</p>

<p>On August 28 the Alsace army was broken
up, only a small part remaining to hold the
region of Thann and the Vosges.</p>

<p>The purpose of the operations in Alsace was,
namely, to retain a large part of the enemy's
forces far from the northern theatre of operations.
It was for our offensive in Lorraine to
pursue still more directly by holding before it
the German army corps operating to the south
of Metz.</p>

<p>This offensive began brilliantly on August 14.
On the 19th we had reached the region of
Saarburg and that of the Etangs, (lakes,) and
we held Dieuze, Morhange, Delme, and Ch&acirc;teau
Salins.</p>

<div class="sidenote">French
offensive
stopped.</div>

<p>On the 20th our success was stopped. The
cause is to be found in the strong organization
of the region, in the power of the enemy's artillery,
operating over ground which had been
minutely surveyed, and, finally, in the default
of certain units.</p>

<div class="sidenote">German
reinforcements.</div>

<p>On the 22d, in spite of the splendid behavior
of several of our army corps, notably that of
Nancy, our troops were brought back on to the
Grand Couronne, while on the 23d and 24th
the Germans concentrated reinforcements&mdash;three
army corps, at least&mdash;in the region of
Lun&eacute;ville and forced us to retire to the south.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>This retreat, however, was only momentary.
On the 25th, after two vigorous counter-attacks,
one from south to north and the other
from west to east, the enemy had to fall back.
From that time a sort of balance was established
on this terrain between the Germans
and ourselves. Maintained for fifteen days, it
was afterward, as will be seen, modified to our
advantage.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Battle
of the
north.</div>

<p>There remained the principal business, the
battle of the north&mdash;postponed owing to the
necessity of waiting for the British Army. On
August 20 the concentration of our lines was
finished and the General in Chief gave orders
for our centre and our left to take the offensive.
Our centre comprised two armies. Our left
consisted of a third army, reinforced to the extent
of two army corps, a corps of cavalry, the
reserve divisions, the British Army, and the
Belgian Army, which had already been engaged
for the previous three weeks at <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Li&eacute;ge'">Li&egrave;ge</ins>, Namur,
and Louvain.</p>

<p>The German plan on that date was as follows:
From seven to eight army corps and
four cavalry divisions were endeavoring to
pass between Givet and Brussels, and even to
prolong their movements more to the west.
Our object was, therefore, in the first place,
to hold and dispose of the enemy's centre and
afterward to throw ourselves with all available
forces on the left flank of the German grouping
of troops in the north.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
offensive
fails.</div>

<p>On August 21 our offensive in the centre began
with ten army corps. On August 22 it
failed, and this reverse appeared serious.</p>

<p>The reasons for it are complex. There were
in this affair individual and collective failures,
imprudences committed under the fire of the
enemy, divisions ill-engaged, rash deployments,
precipitate retreats, a premature waste of
men, and, finally, the inadequacy of certain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
of our troops and their leaders, both as regards
the use of infantry and artillery.</p>

<p>In consequence of these lapses the enemy,
turning to account the difficult terrain, was
able to secure the maximum of profit from the
advantages which the superiority of his subaltern
complements gave him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Enemy
crosses
the
Sambre.</div>

<p>In spite of this defeat our manoeuvre had
still a chance of success, if our left and the British
Army obtained a decisive result. This was
unfortunately not the case. On August 22, at
the cost of great losses, the enemy succeeded
in crossing the Sambre and our left army fell
back on the 24th upon Beaumont-Givet, being
perturbed by the belief that the enemy was
threatening its right.</p>

<p>On the same day, (the 24th,) the British
Army fell back after a German attack upon the
Maubeuge-Valenciennes line. On the 25th and
26th its retreat became more hurried. After
Landrecies and Le Cateau it fell back southward
by forced marches. It could not from
this time keep its hold until after crossing the
Marne.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
British
retreat.</div>

<p>The rapid retreat of the English, coinciding
with the defeat sustained in Belgian Luxembourg,
allowed the enemy to cross the Meuse
and to accelerate, by fortifying it, the action
of his right.</p>

<p>The situation at this moment may be thus
summed up: Either our frontier had to be defended
on the spot under conditions which the
British retreat rendered extremely perilous, or
we had to execute a strategic retirement which,
while delivering up to the enemy a part of the
national soil, would permit us, on the other
hand, to resume the offensive at our own time
with a favorable disposition of troops, still intact,
which we had at our command. The General
in Chief determined on the second alternative.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">New
offensive
planned.</div>

<p>Henceforward the French command devoted
its efforts to preparing the offensive. To this
end three conditions had to be fulfilled:</p>

<p>1. The retreat had to be carried out in order
under a succession of counter-attacks which
would keep the enemy busy.</p>

<p>2. The extreme point of this retreat must be
fixed in such a way that the different armies
should reach it simultaneously, ready at the
moment of occupying it to resume the offensive
all together.</p>

<p>3. Every circumstance permitting of a resumption
of the offensive before this point
should be reached must be utilized by the whole
of our forces and the British forces.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Counter-attacks.</div>

<p>The counter-attacks, executed during the retreat,
were brilliant and often fruitful. On
August 20 we successfully attacked St. Quentin
to disengage the British Army. Two other
corps and a reserve division engaged the Prussian
Guard and the Tenth German Army Corps,
which was debouching from Guise. By the end
of the day, after various fluctuations, the
enemy was thrown back on the Oise and the
British front was freed.</p>

<p>On August 27 we had also succeeded in
throwing back upon the Meuse the enemy, who
was endeavoring to gain a foothold on the left
bank. Our successes continued on the 28th in
the woods of Marf&eacute;e and of Jaulnay. Thanks
to them we were able, in accordance with
the orders of the General in Chief, to fall
back on the Buzancy-Le Chesne-Bouvellemont
line.</p>

<p>Further to the right another army took part
in the same movement and carried out successful
attacks on August 25 on the Othain and
in the region of Spincourt.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Recrossing
the
Meuse.</div>

<p>On the 26th these different units recrossed
the Meuse without being disturbed and were
able to join in the action of our centre. Our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
armies were, therefore, again intact and available
for the offensive.</p>

<p>On August 26 a new army composed of two
army corps, five reserve divisions, and a Moorish
brigade was constituted. This army was
to assemble in the region of Amiens between
August 27 and September 1 and take the offensive
against the German right, uniting its
action with that of the British Army, operating
on the line of Ham-Bray-sur-Somme.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
retreat
continues.</div>

<p>The hope of resuming the offensive was from
this moment rendered vain by the rapidity of
the march of the German right wing. This
rapidity had two consequences, which we had
to parry before thinking of advancing. On the
one hand, our new army had not time to complete
its detraining, and, on the other hand, the
British Army, forced back further by the
enemy, uncovered on August 31 our left flank.
Our line, thus modified, contained waves which
had to be redressed before we could pass to the
offensive.</p>

<p>To understand this it is sufficient to consider
the situation created by the quick advance
of the enemy on the evening of September
2.</p>

<p>A corps of cavalry had crossed the Oise and
advanced as far as Ch&acirc;teau-Thierry. The First
Army, (General von Kluck,) comprising four
active army corps and a reserve corps, had
passed Compi&egrave;gne.</p>

<p>The Second Army, (General von B&uuml;low,)
with three active army corps and two reserve
corps, was reaching the Laon region.</p>

<p>The Third Army, (General von Hausen,)
with two active army corps and a reserve corps,
had crossed the Aisne between the Ch&acirc;teau
Porcien and Attigny.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
German
armies.</div>

<p>More to the east the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth
and Seventh Armies, namely, twelve army
corps, four reserve corps, and numerous Ersatz<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
formations, were in contact with our troops,
the Fourth and Fifth Armies between Vouziers
and Verdun and the others in the positions
which have been indicated above, from Verdun
to the Vosges.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The left
in peril.</div>

<p>It will, therefore, be seen that our left, if
we accepted battle, might be in great peril
through the British forces and the new French
Army, operating more to the westward, having
given way.</p>

<p>A defeat in these conditions would have cut
off our armies from Paris and from the British
forces and at the same time from the new
army which had been constituted to the left
of the English. We should thus be running
the risk of losing by a single stroke the advantage
of the assistance which Russia later on
was to furnish.</p>

<p>General Joffre chose resolutely for the solution
which disposed of these risks, that is to
say, for postponing the offensive and the continuance
of the retreat. In this way he remained
on ground which he had chosen. He
waited only until he could engage in better
conditions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The limit
of the
retreat.</div>

<p>In consequence, on September 1, he fixed as
an extreme limit for the movement of retreat,
which was still going on, the line of Bray-sur-Seine,
Nogent-sur-Seine, Arcis-sur-Aube,
Vitry-le-Fran&ccedil;ois, and the region to the north
of Bar-le-Duc. This line might be reached if
the troops were compelled to go back so far.
They would attack before reaching it, as soon
as there was a possibility of bringing about an
offensive disposition, permitting the co-operation
of the whole of our forces.</p>

<p>On September 5 it appeared that this desired
situation existed.</p>

<p>The First German Army, carrying audacity
to temerity, had continued its endeavor to envelop
our left, had crossed the Grand Morin,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
and reached the region of Chauffry, to the
north of Rebaix and of Esternay. It aimed
then at cutting our armies off from Paris, in
order to begin the investment of the capital.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
German
lines.</div>

<p>The Second Army had its head on the line
Champaubert, Etoges, Bergeres, and Vertus.</p>

<p>The Third and Fourth Armies reached to
Chalons-sur-Marne and Bussy-le-Repos. The
Fifth Army was advancing on one side and
the other from the Argonne as far as Triacourt-les-Islettes
and Juivecourt. The Sixth
and Seventh Armies were attacking more to
the east.</p>

<p>But&mdash;and here is a capital difference between
the situation of September 5 and that
of September 2&mdash;the envelopment of our left
was no longer possible.</p>

<p>In the first place, our left army had been
able to occupy the line of S&eacute;zanne, Villers-St.
Georges and Courchamps. Furthermore, the
British forces, gathered between the Seine and
the Marne, flanked on their left by the newly
created army, were closely connected with the
rest of our forces.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Allies'
armies
ready.</div>

<p>This was precisely the disposition which the
General in Chief had wished to see achieved.
On the 4th he decided to take advantage of it,
and ordered all the armies to hold themselves
ready. He had taken from his right two new
army corps, two divisions of infantry, and two
divisions of cavalry, which were distributed
between his left and his centre.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 5th he addressed to all
the commanders of armies a message ordering
them to attack.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Joffre
orders the
advance.</div>

<p>"The hour has come," he wrote, "to advance
at all costs, and to die where you stand rather
than give way."</p>

<p>If one examines on the map the respective
positions of the German and French armies
on September 6 as previously described, it will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
be seen that by his inflection toward Meaux
and Coulommiers General von Kluck was exposing
his right to the offensive action of our
left. This is the starting point of the victory
of the Marne.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Battle
of the
Marne.</div>

<p>On the evening of September 5 our left army
had reached the front Penchard-Saint-Soutlet-Ver.
On the 6th and 7th it continued its attacks
vigorously with the Ourcq as objective.
On the evening of the 7th it was some kilometers
from the Ourcq, on the front
Chambry-Marcilly-Lisieux-Acy-en-Multien. On the 8th,
the Germans, who had in great haste reinforced
their right by bringing their Second
and Fourth Army Corps back to the north,
obtained some successes by attacks of extreme
violence. They occupied Betz, Thury-en-Valois,
and Nanteuil-le-Haudouin. But in spite of this
pressure our troops held their ground well. In
a brilliant action they took three standards,
and, being reinforced, prepared a new attack
for the 10th. At the moment that this attack
was about to begin the enemy was already in
retreat toward the north. The attack became
a pursuit, and on the 12th we established ourselves
on the Aisne.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Enemy
left
exposed.</div>

<p>Why did the German forces which were confronting
us and on the evening before attacking
so furiously retreat on the morning of the
10th? Because in bringing back on the 6th
several army corps from the south to the north
to face our left the enemy had exposed his left
to the attacks of the British Army, which had
immediately faced around toward the north,
and to those of our armies which were prolonging
the English lines to the right. This
is what the French command had sought to
bring about. This is what happened on September
8 and allowed the development and rehabilitation
which it was to effect.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The part
of the
British.</div>

<p>On the 6th the British Army had set out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
from the line Rozcy-Lagny and had that evening
reached the southward bank of the Grand
Morin. On the 7th and 8th it continued its
march, and on the 9th had debouched to the
north of the Marne below <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Chateau'">Ch&acirc;teau</ins>-Thierry,
taking in flank the German forces which on
that day were opposing, on the Ourcq, our left
army. Then it was that these forces began
to retreat, while the British Army, going in
pursuit and capturing seven guns and many
prisoners, reached the Aisne between Soissons
and Longueval.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The r&ocirc;le
of the
French army.</div>

<p>The r&ocirc;le of the French Army, which was operating
to the right of the British Army, was
threefold. It had to support the British attacking
on its left. It had on its right to
support our centre, which from September 7
had been subjected to a German attack of great
violence. Finally, its mission was to throw
back the three active army corps and the reserve
corps which faced it.</p>

<p>On the 7th it made a leap forward, and on
the following days reached and crossed the
Marne, seizing, after desperate fighting, guns,
howitzers, mitrailleuses, and 1,300,000 cartridges.
On the 12th it established itself on the
north edge of the Montagne-de-Reime in contact
with our centre, which for its part had just
forced the enemy to retreat in haste.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Attack
on the
French
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'center'">centre</ins>.</div>

<p>Our centre consisted of a new army created
on August 29 and of one of those which at the
beginning of the campaign had been engaged
in Belgian Luxembourg. The first had retreated
on August 29 to September 5 from the Aisne
to the north of the Marne and occupied the
general front S&eacute;zanne-Mailly.</p>

<p>The second, more to the east, had drawn back
to the south of the line
Humbauville-<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Chateau'">Ch&acirc;teau</ins>-Beauchamp-Bignicourt-Blesmes-Maurupt-le-Montoy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A further
retreat.</div>

<p>The enemy, in view of his right being arrested<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
and the defeat of his enveloping movement,
made a desperate effort from the 7th to the 10th
to pierce our centre to the west and to the east
of <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'F&eacute;re'">F&egrave;re</ins>-Champenoise. On the 8th he succeeded
in forcing back the right of our new army,
which retired as far as Gouragan&ccedil;on. On the
9th, at 6 o'clock in the morning, there was a
further retreat to the south of that village,
while on the left the other army corps also had
to go back to the line Allemant-Connantre.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Foch
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'out-man&#339;uvers'">out-man&#339;uvres</ins>

<p>Despite this retreat the General commanding
the army ordered a general offensive for the
same day. With the Morocco Division, whose
behavior was heroic, he met a furious assault
of the Germans on his left toward the marshes
of Saint Gond. Then with the division which
had just victoriously overcome the attacks of
the enemy to the north of S&eacute;zanne, and with
the whole of his left army corps, he made a
flanking attack in the evening of the 9th upon
the German forces, and notably the guard,
which had thrown back his right army corps.
The enemy, taken by surprise by this bold
man&#339;uvre, did not resist, and beat a hasty retreat.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Centre
armies established.</div>

<p>On the 11th we crossed the Marne between
Tours-sur-Marne and Sarry, driving the Germans
in front of us in disorder. On the 12th
we were in contact with the enemy to the north
of the Camp de Chalons. Our other army of
the centre, acting on the right of the one just
referred to, had been intrusted with the mission
during the 7th, 8th, and 9th of disengaging
its neighbor, and it was only on the 10th
that, being reinforced by an army corps from
the east, it was able to make its action effectively
felt. On the 11th the Germans retired.
But, perceiving their danger, they fought desperately,
with enormous expenditure of projectiles,
behind strong intrenchments. On the
12th the result had none the less been attained,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
and our two centre armies were solidly established
on the ground gained.</p>

<p>To the right of these two armies were three
others. They had orders to cover themselves
to the north and to debouch toward the west
on the flank of the enemy, which was operating
to the west of the Argonne. But a wide interval
in which the Germans were in force separated
them from our centre. The attack took
place, nevertheless, with very brilliant success
for our artillery, which destroyed eleven batteries
of the Sixteenth German Army Corps.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Germans
retreat
on the
right.</div>

<p>On the 10th inst. the Eighth and Fifteenth
German Army Corps counter-attacked, but
were repulsed. On the 11th our progress continued
with new successes, and on the 12th we
were able to face round toward the north in
expectation of the near and inevitable retreat
of the enemy, which, in fact, took place from
the 13th.</p>

<p>The withdrawal of the mass of the German
force involved also that of the left. From the
12th onward the forces of the enemy operating
between Nancy and the Vosges retreated in a
hurry before our two armies of the East, which
immediately occupied the positions that the
enemy had evacuated. The offensive of our
right had thus prepared and consolidated in the
most useful way the result secured by our left
and our centre.</p>

<p>Such was this seven days' battle, in which
more than two millions of men were engaged.
Each army gained ground step by step, opening
the road to its neighbor, supported at once
by it, taking in flank the adversary which the
day before it had attacked in front, the efforts
of one articulating closely with those of the
other, a perfect unity of intention and method
animating the supreme command.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Meaning
of the
victory.</div>

<p>To give this victory all its meaning it is
necessary to add that it was gained by troops<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
which for two weeks had been retreating, and
which, when the order for the offensive was
given, were found to be as ardent as on the
first day. It has also to be said that these
troops had to meet the whole German army,
and that from the time they marched forward
they never again fell back. Under their pressure
the German retreat at certain times had
the appearance of a rout.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Numbers

prisoners.</div>

<p>In spite of the fatigue of our men, in spite
of the power of the German heavy artillery,
we took colors, guns, mitrailleuses, shells,
more than a million cartridges, and thousands
of prisoners. A German corps lost almost the
whole of its artillery, which, from information
brought by our airmen, was destroyed by our
guns.</p>

<p>After the failure of the German drive against
Paris, whose capture was the first objective
in the plan of campaign of the German General
Staff, preparations were made to carry out
the plans for the second objective, the capture
of the Channel seaports, and the control of
the coasts. The Allied commanders were quite
aware of this purpose, and made plans to circumvent
it. Then followed the famous Race
for the Channel, which is described by official
French observers in the pages that follow.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE RACE FOR THE CHANNEL</h2>

<h3>FRENCH OFFICIAL ACCOUNT</h3>


<p>As early as September 11 the Commander
in Chief had directed our left army to
have as important forces as possible on
the right bank of the Oise. On September 17 he
made that instruction more precise by ordering
"a mass to be constituted on the left wing of
our disposition, capable of coping with the outflanking
movement of the enemy." Everything
led us to expect that flanking movement, for
the Germans are lacking in invention. Indeed,
their effort at that time tended to a renewal of
their manoeuvre of August. In the parallel
race the opponents were bound in the end to
be stopped only by the sea; that is what happened
about October 20.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Allies
in the
race to
the sea.</div>

<p>The Germans had an advantage over us,
which is obvious from a glance at the map&mdash;the
concentric form of their front, which
shortened the length of their transports. In
spite of this initial inferiority we arrived in
time.</p>

<p>From the middle of September to the last
week in October fighting went on continually
to the north of the Oise, but all the time
we were fighting we were slipping northward.
On the German side this movement
brought into line more than eighteen new
army corps (twelve active army corps, six reserve
corps, four cavalry corps). On our side
it ended in the constitution of three fresh
armies on our left and in the transport into
the same district of the British Army and the
Belgian Army from Antwerp.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Resistance
in
Battle of
Flanders.</div>

<p>For the conception and realization of this
fresh and extended disposition the French command,
in the first place, had to reduce to a
minimum the needs for effectives of our armies
to the east of the Oise, and afterwards to utilize
to the utmost our means of transport. It
succeeded in this, and when, at the end of
October, the battle of Flanders opened, when
the Germans, having completed the concentration
of their forces, attempted with fierce energy
to turn or to pierce our left, they flung
themselves upon a resistance which inflicted
upon them a complete defeat.</p>

<p>The movement began on our side only with
the resources of the army which had held the
left of our front during the battle of the
Marne, reinforced on September 15 by one
army corps.</p>

<p>This reinforcement, not being sufficient to
hold the enemy's offensive (district of Vaudelincourt-Mouchy-Uaugy),
a fresh army was
transported more to the left, with the task
"of acting against the German right wing in
order to disengage its neighbor, * * * while
preserving a flanking direction in its march
in relation to the fresh units that the enemy
might be able to put into line."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Reinforcements
for
the First
Army.</div>

<p>To cover the detrainments of this fresh army
in the district Clermont-Beauvais-Boix a cavalry
corps and four territorial divisions were
ordered to establish themselves on both banks
of the Somme. In the wooded hills, however,
which extend between the Oise and Lassigny
the enemy displayed increasing activity.
Nevertheless, the order still further to broaden
the movement toward the left was maintained,
while the territorial divisions were to move
toward Bethune and Aubigny. The march to
the sea went on.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Alternate
reverse
and
success.</div>

<p>From the 21st to the 26th all our forces
were engaged in the district Lassigny-Roye-Peronne,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
with alternations of reverse and
success.</p>

<p>It was the first act of the great struggle
which was to spread as it went on. On the
26th the whole of the Sixth German Army was
deployed against us. We retained all our positions,
but we could do no more; consequently
there was still the risk that the enemy, by
means of a fresh afflux of forces, might succeed
in turning us.</p>

<p>Once more reinforcements, two army corps,
were directed no longer on Beauvais, but
toward Amiens. The front was then again to
extend. A fresh army was constituted more
to the north.</p>

<p>From September 30 onward we could not
but observe that the enemy, already strongly
posted on the plateau of Thiepval, was continually
slipping his forces from south to
north, and everywhere confronting us with remarkable
energy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cavalry
operations.</div>

<p>Accordingly, on October 1 two cavalry corps
were directed to make a leap forward and,
operating on both flanks of the Scarpe, to put
themselves in touch with the garrison of Dunkirk,
which, on its side, had pushed forward
as far as Douai.</p>

<p>But on October 2 and 3 the bulk of our
fresh army was very strongly attacked in
the district of Arras and Lens. Confronting
it were two corps of cavalry, the guards,
four active army corps, and two reserve
corps. A fresh army corps was immediately
transported and detrained in the Lille
district.</p>

<p>But once more the attacks became more
pressing, and on October 4 it was a question
whether, in view of the enemy's activity both
west of the Oise and south of the Somme, and
also further to the north, a retreat would not
have to be made. General Joffre resolutely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
put this hypothesis aside and ordered the
offensive to be resumed with the reinforcements
that had arrived. It was, however,
clear that, despite the efforts of all, our front,
extended to the sea as it was by a mere ribbon
of troops, did not possess the solidity to
enable it to resist with complete safety a German
attack, the violence of which could well
be foreseen.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Transport
of the
British
Army.</div>

<p>In the Arras district the position was fairly
good. But between the Oise and Arras we
were holding our own only with difficulty.
Finally, to the north, on the Lille-Estaires-Merville-Hazebrouck-Cassel
front, our cavalry
and our territorials had their work cut out
against eight divisions of German cavalry,
with very strong infantry supports. It was
at this moment that the transport of the British
Army to the northern theatre of operations
began.</p>

<div class="sidenote">British
Army
taken
from the
Aisne.</div>

<p>Field Marshal French had, as early as the
end of September, expressed the wish to see
his army resume its initial place on the left of
the allied armies. He explained this wish on
the ground of the greater facility of which his
communications would have the advantage in
this new position, and also of the impending
arrival of two divisions of infantry from home
and of two infantry divisions and a cavalry
division from India, which would be able to
deploy more easily on that terrain. In spite
of the difficulties which such a removal involved,
owing to the intensive use of the railways
by our own units, General Joffre decided
at the beginning of October to meet the Field
Marshal's wishes and to have the British Army
removed from the Aisne.</p>

<p>It was clearly specified that on the northern
terrain the British Army should co-operate to
the same end as ourselves, the stopping of the
German right. In other terms, the British<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
Army was to prolong the front of the general
disposition without a break, attacking as soon
as possible, and at the same time seeking touch
with the Belgian Army.</p>

<p>But the detraining took longer than had
been expected, and it was not possible to attack
the Germans during the time when they
had only cavalry in the Lille district and further
to the north.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Wearied
Belgian
troops.</div>

<p>There remained the Belgian Army. On leaving
Antwerp on October 9 the Belgian Army,
which was covered by 8,000 British bluejackets
and 6,000 French bluejackets, at first intended
to retire as far as to the north of Calais, but
afterwards determined to make a stand in Belgian
territory. Unfortunately, the condition
of the Belgian troops, exhausted by a struggle
of more than three months, did not allow any
immediate hopes to be based upon them. This
situation weighed on our plans and delayed
their execution.</p>

<p>On the 16th we made progress to the east of
Ypres. On the 18th our cavalry even reached
Roulers and Cortemark. But it was now evident
that, in view of the continual reinforcing
of the German right, our left was not capable
of maintaining the advantages obtained during
the previous few days. To attain our end
and make our front inviolable a fresh effort
was necessary. That effort was immediately
made by the dispatch to the north of the Lys of
considerable French forces, which formed the
French Army of Belgium.</p>

<p>The French Army of Belgium consisted, to
begin with, of two territorial divisions, four
divisions of cavalry, and a naval brigade.
Directly after its constitution it was strengthened
by elements from other points on the front
whose arrival extended from October 27 to November
11. These reinforcements were equivalent
altogether in value to five army corps, a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
division of cavalry, a territorial division, and
sixteen regiments of cavalry, plus sixty pieces
of heavy artillery.</p>

<p>Thus was completed the strategic manoeuvre
defined by the instructions of the General in
Chief on September 11 and developed during
the five following weeks with the ampleness we
have just seen. The movements of troops carried
out during this period were methodically
combined with the pursuit of operations, both
defensive and offensive, from the Oise to the
North Sea.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Five
armies
co-ordinated.</div>

<p>On October 22 our left, bounded six weeks
earlier by the Noyon district, rested on Nieuport,
thanks to the successive deployment of
five fresh armies&mdash;three French armies, the
British Army, and the Belgian Army.</p>

<p>Thus the co-ordination decided upon by the
General in Chief attained its end. The barrier
was established. It remained to maintain it
against the enemy's offensive. That was the
object and the result of the battle of Flanders,
October 22 to November 15.</p>

<p>The German attack in Flanders was conducted
strategically and tactically with remarkable
energy. The complete and indisputable
defeat in which it resulted is therefore
significant.</p>

<p>The forces of which the enemy disposed for
this operation between the sea and the Lys
comprised:</p>

<div class="sidenote">German
forces between
the sea
and the
Lys.</div>

<p>(1) The entire Fourth Army commanded by
the Duke of W&uuml;rttemberg, consisting of one
naval division, one division of Ersatz Reserve,
(men who had received no training before the
war,) which was liberated by the fall of Antwerp;
the Twenty-second, Twenty-third, Twenty-sixth
and Twenty-seventh Reserve Corps,
and the Forty-eighth Division belonging to the
Twenty-fourth Reserve Corps.</p>

<p>(2) A portion of another army under General<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
von Fabeck, consisting of the Fifteenth
Corps, two Bavarian corps and three (unspecified)
divisions.</p>

<p>(3) Part of the Sixth Army under the command
of the Crown Prince of Bavaria. This
army, more than a third of which took part in
the battle of Flanders, comprised the Nineteenth
Army Corps, portions of the Thirteenth
Corps and the Eighteenth Reserve Corps, the
Seventh and Fourteenth Corps, the First Bavarian
Reserve Corps, the Guards, and the
Fourth Army Corps.</p>

<p>(4) Four highly mobile cavalry corps prepared
and supported the action of the troops
enumerated above. Everything possible had
been done to fortify the "morale" of the troops.
At the beginning of October the Crown Prince
of Bavaria in a proclamation had exhorted his
soldiers "to make the decisive effort against
the French left wing," and "to settle thus the
fate of the great battle which has lasted for
weeks."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Importance
of
thrusts in
Flanders.</div>

<div class="sidenote">German
plan in
Flanders.</div>

<p>On October 28, Prince Rupprecht of Bavaria
declared in an army order that his
troops "had just been fighting under very difficult
conditions," and he added: "It is our
business now not to let the struggle with our
most detested enemy drag on longer * * * The
decisive blow is still to be struck." On October
30, General von Deimling, commanding
the Fifteenth Army Corps (belonging to General
von Fabeck's command), issued an order
declaring that "the thrust against Ypres will
be of decisive importance." It should be noted
also that the Emperor proceeded in person to
Thielt and Courtrai to exalt by his presence
the ardor of his troops. Finally, at the close
of October, the entire German press incessantly
proclaimed the importance of the "Battle of
Calais." It is superfluous to add that events
in Poland explain in a large measure the passionate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
resolve of the German General Staff to
obtain a decision in the Western theatre of operations
at all costs. This decision would be
obtained if our left were pierced or driven in.
To reach Calais, that is, to break our left; to
carry Ypres, that is, to cut it in half; through
both points to menace the communications
and supplies of the British expeditionary
corps, perhaps even to threaten Britain in her
island&mdash;such was the German plan in the Battle
of Flanders. It was a plan that could not
be executed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dunkirk
the first
objective.</div>

<p>The enemy, who had at his disposal a considerable
quantity of heavy artillery, directed
his efforts at first upon the coast and the country
to the north of Dixmude. His objective
was manifestly the capture of Dunkirk, then of
Calais and Boulogne, and this objective he
pursued until November 1.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ramscapelle
retaken.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Allies
win the
Battle of
Calais.</div>

<p>On October 23 the Belgians along the railway
line from Nieuport to Dixmude were
strengthened by a French division. Dixmude
was occupied by our marines (fusiliers marins).
During the subsequent day our forces along
the railway developed a significant resistance
against an enemy superior in number and
backed by heavy artillery. On the 29th the inundations
effected between the canal and the
railway line spread along our front. On the
30th we recaptured Ramscapelle, the only point
on the railway which Belgians had lost. On
the 1st and 2d of November the enemy bombarded
Furnes, but began to show signs of
weariness. On the 2d he evacuated the ground
between the Yser and the railway, abandoning
cannon, dead and wounded. On the 3d our
troops were able to re-enter the Dixmude district.
The success achieved by the enemy at
Dixmude at this juncture was without fruit.
They succeeded in taking the town. They could
not debouch from it. The coastal attack had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
thus proved a total failure. Since then it has
never been renewed. The Battle of Calais, so
noisily announced by the German press,
amounted to a decided reverse for the Germans.</p>

<p>The enemy had now begun an attack more
important than its predecessor, in view of
the numbers engaged in it. This attack was
intended as a renewal to the south of the effort
which had just been shattered in the north.
Instead of turning our flank on the coast, it was
now sought to drive in the right of our northern
army under the shock of powerful masses.
This was the Battle of Ypres.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Importance
of
the Ypres
position.</div>

<div class="sidenote">British
cavalry a
connecting
link.</div>

<p>In order to understand this long, desperate,
and furious battle we must hark back a few
days in point of time. At the moment when
our cavalry reached Roulers and Cortemark
(October 28) our territorial divisions from
Dunkirk, under General Biden, had occupied
and organized a defensive position at Ypres.
It was a point d'appui, enabling us to prepare
and maintain our connections with the Belgian
Army. From October 23 two British and
French army corps were in occupation of this
position, which was to be the base of their
forward march in the direction of Roulers-Menin.
The delays already explained and the
strength of the forces brought up by the enemy
soon brought to a standstill our progress along
the line Poelcapelle, Paschendaele, Zandvorde,
and Gheluvelt. But in spite of the stoppage
here, Ypres was solidly covered, and the connections
of all the allied forces were established.
Against the line thus formed the German
attack was hurled from October 25 to
November 13, to the north, the east, and the
south of Ypres. From October 26 on the attacks
were renewed daily with extraordinary
violence, obliging us to employ our reinforcements
at the most threatened points as soon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
as they came up. Thus, on October 31, we
were obliged to send supports to the British
cavalry, then to the two British corps between
which the cavalry formed the connecting link,
and finally to intercalate between these two
corps a force equivalent to two army corps.
Between October 30 and November 6 Ypres was
several times in danger. The British lost Zandvorde,
Gheluvelt, Messines, and Wytschaete.
The front of the Allies, thus contracted, was
all the more difficult to defend; but defended it
was without a recoil.</p>

<div class="sidenote">French
reinforcements.</div>

<p>The arrival of three French divisions in our
line enabled us to resume from the 4th to the
8th a vigorous offensive. On the 10th and
11th this offensive, brought up against fresh
and sharper German attacks, was checked. Before
it could be renewed the arrival of fresh
reinforcements had to be awaited, which were
dispatched to the north on November 12. By
the 14th our troops had again begun to progress,
barring the road to Ypres against the
German attacks, and inflicting on the enemy,
who advanced in massed formation, losses
which were especially terrible in consequence
of the fact that the French artillery had
crowded nearly 300 guns on to these few kilometers
of front.</p>

<p>Thus the main mass of the Germans sustained
the same defeat as the detachments operating
further to the north along the coast.
The support which, according to the idea of
the German General Staff, the attack on Ypres
was to render to the coastal attack, was as
futile as that attack itself had been.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Losses
of the
enemy.</div>

<p>During the second half of November the
enemy, exhausted and having lost in the Battle
of Ypres alone more than 150,000 men, did not
attempt to renew his effort, but confined himself
to an intermittent cannonade. We, on
the contrary, achieved appreciable progress to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
the north and south of Ypres, and insured definitely
by a powerful defensive organization of
the position the inviolability of our front.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The territory
left
to the
Belgians.</div>

<p>We have seen that, with the fall of Li&egrave;ge
the German armies swept through Belgium on
their way to Paris. Brussels was abandoned
as the capital, and the Government moved
hastily to Antwerp, where a portion of the
Belgian army also gathered to defend the city.
The remainder of the Belgian forces, under
the leadership of their gallant King, opposed
as stoutly as their numbers would permit the
advance of the Germans. Battles were fought
at Alost and Termonde in which the Germans
were, for the time, repulsed, but their ever-increasing
reinforcements enabled them to advance
despite the efforts of the Belgians to
check them. Ghent was captured on September
5 and the Belgians, in an effort to stay
the German advance on Antwerp, opened the
dikes and let in the waters of the North Sea.
Termonde fell on September 13, and seven
days later the German armies began the siege
of Antwerp. The military authorities in command
of the city had taken whatever measures
were possible for defense. A body of British
marines was hurried to the beleaguered city
and preparations were made for a long siege.
The Germans brought up guns of heavy caliber,
with which they bombarded the city at long
range. After a brave defense of two weeks,
during which the inhabitants endured many
hardships, it was plain that further resistance
was useless, and the city was surrendered on
October 10. The Belgian troops in the city,
and many of the noncombatants escaped. The
Belgian troops retreated to Ostend, which they
reached on October 11 and 12, after having been
greatly harassed by the pursuing Germans.
On the 13th, Ostend was evacuated, and was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
occupied by the Germans, and Bruges on the
following day. The German forces now controlled
the whole of Belgium, with the exception
of the northwest corner, north of Ypres,
to the coast of the Channel. This little slip
of territory they held throughout the entire
war, and at what a cost! But the heroic defense
of this territory by the Belgians saved
the French coast cities and prevented the Germans
from breaking through the line which extended
now from the North Sea to Belgium.</p>

<h2>THE LAST DITCH IN BELGIUM</h2>

<h3>ARNO DOSCH</h3>


<div class="sidenote">The Yser
the Belgian's
last
ditch.</div>

<p>A little piece of the Low Countries, so
small I walked across it in two hours, was
all that remained of Belgium in the last
days of October. A tide-water stream, the
Yser, ebbed and flowed through the sunken
fields, and there King Albert with his remnant
of an army stopped the German military machine
in its advance on Calais. If he and his
forty thousand men had been crushed back ten
miles farther they would have been fighting on
French soil. The Yser was the last ditch in
Belgium.</p>

<p>The Belgians were able to hold that mere
strip of land against more men and better artillery
because they had determined to die
there. Some of those who had not yet paid the
price of death told me. They were not tragic
about it. There was no display of heroics.
They said it seriously, but they smiled a little,
too, over their wine glasses, and the next morning
they were back in the firing-line.</p>

<p>I counted on my American passport and my
<i>permit de sejour</i> in Paris seeing me through the
zone of the fighting, and they did. At the
station at Dunkirk, when I admitted I had no
<i>laisser passer</i>, an obliging gendarme led me
to his commander, and he placed his vis&eacute;e on
my passport without question. He asked me
whether I was a correspondent, and I confessed
to it, but it seemed only to facilitate the affair.
Earlier experiences had made me feel that the
French gendarmes were my natural enemies,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
but I have had a kindlier regard for them
since.</p>


<div class="sidenote">Troop
trains.</div>

<p>The train I was on had ten cars full of
French and Belgian soldiers. The Belgians had
all been recently re-equipped. On other troop
trains which passed us going forward there
were many more Belgian soldiers, some of
whom I had seen only a few hours earlier in
the streets of Calais without rifles. As their
trains passed now I could see them studying
the mechanism and fondling their new firearms.</p>

<p>Coming in through the suburbs of Dunkirk
we passed hundreds of children perched on the
fences singing the Marseillaise. Nor were their
voices flat and colorless like most school children's.
They felt every word they sang, and
they put their little hearts into it. Looking
back along the side of the cars at the faces of
soldiers leaning out, I could see they were
touched by the faith of the children.</p>

<div class="sidenote">In
Dunkirk.</div>

<p>As I rattled along on the cobbles of Dunkirk
half an hour later I heard an explosion with a
note unfamiliar to me. It sounded close, too,
but it did not seem to bother the people of the
street. A few children ran behind their
mothers' skirts and a young girl hurried from
the middle of the street to the protection of an
archway, but that was all.</p>

<p>Standing up in the fiacre I could see a thin
smoke about three hundred feet away in a garden
in the direction from which the explosion
came, and high in the evening sky I could barely
make out an aeroplane. "A German bomb?"
I asked the driver in some excitement.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," he replied, cracking his whip, "we
usually get three or four every afternoon about
this time, but they have not hurt any one."</p>

<p>Dunkirk that night answered the description
of what a threatened town which was not
afraid should look like. It had none of the depressing
atmosphere of Calais. All the refugees<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
and the wounded were passed on to a safer
place. It was full of French, English, and Belgian
soldiers, with a scattering of sailors and
breezy officers from both the French and English
navies. They kept the waiters in the caf&eacute;s
on the run, and there was only an occasional
bandage showing from under a cap or around
a hand to indicate these men were engaged in
any more serious business than a man&#339;uvre.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Armored
motor-car.</div>

<p>In the street, however, in front of the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'statute'">statue</ins>
of Jean Bart, an armored Belgian motor-car
was standing. It was built with a turret where
the tonneau usually is and it was covered with
thick sheet steel right down to the ground. Just
in front of the driver was a slit with a lip extending
over it, giving it somewhat the effect
of the casque belonging to an ancient suit of
armor. That was the only opening except the
one for the barrel of the rapid-fire gun in the
turret. The armor was dented in a dozen places
where bullets had glanced off, but it had only
been penetrated at one spot, about six inches
from the muzzle of the gun. From the soldier
at the steering gear I learned that that bullet
had passed over the shoulder of the man in the
turret.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Bombardment
of
Nieuport.</div>

<p>Twenty-four hours later, at Nieuport, when
the German shells seemed to be falling in every
street and on every house, I saw this car again,
going forward at not less than forty miles an
hour. The turret was being swung to bring
the gun-muzzle forward, as if the gunner were
expecting to go into action almost immediately.
As the last of the Belgian trenches were just
the other side of the town, I have no doubt that
he did.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A walk
to the
firing
line.</div>

<p>Getting out of Dunkirk was rather more of
a problem than going in. To obtain permission
to ride toward the Belgian line in any kind of
conveyance was an elaborate performance, and
quite properly so, as I soon learned. There<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
were preparations for defence going on there
which should not have been publicly known.
The country was full of spies. Four suspects
had been picked up on the boat coming from
Folkestone. If I had realized what I was to
see in the next few miles I would not have attempted
what I did. But, as I was anxious
to get on and the firing-line was only twenty
miles away, I decided to walk.</p>

<p>A French hat and a French suit of clothes, I
think, were alone responsible for my success
in passing through the city gate. Two military
automobiles were stopped and forced to show
their credentials, but I strolled through unmolested.
Once outside, the reservists guarding
the various barricades let me pass as soon
as I showed them my passport vis&eacute;d in Dunkirk.
I was stopped many times, too, trying
each time not to give an appearance of too great
interest in the works of defence being built all
around me.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sand-dune
barricades.</div>

<p>Even though this cannot be published for
some time I do not feel free to tell what these
defences were. I have no doubt there are complete
descriptions of these works in the hands
of the German army, their spy system is so thorough,
but I would not care to have any military
secrets escape through anything I write.
I think I can go so far as to say, though, that I
received a liberal education in how to barricade
sand-dunes and low-lying fields.</p>

<p>Ten miles out of Dunkirk I was surprised to
see a civilian on a bicycle, as civilians were no
longer permitted to go near the theatre of war
on bicycles, a precaution taken against spies.
As he approached I recognized Mr. J. Obels,
the Belgian correspondent of the Chicago <i>Daily
News</i>, whom I had last seen under arrest near
Brussels when the German army first passed
through Belgium. He told me he had been kept
in prison seventeen days by the German military<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
governor of Brussels, but, once released,
was given every possible kind of pass. I was
relieved to see him alive and free.</p>

<p>As Obels left me to continue his journey to
Dunkirk and on to London to deliver his own
"copy," he advised me to go directly to Furnes,
the most considerable town in what was left of
Belgium, and have my passport vis&eacute;d again.
So I continued down the long, flat highway,
bordered on both sides by sunken fields, toward
the cannonading I could now hear ahead. The
road had been fairly full of automobiles, motor-trucks,
motorcycles, and bicycles over its whole
length, but it became crowded now with the
addition of a long string of Parisian motor-buses
taking several infantry regiments forward.
A whole artillery division of yellow
French "Schneiders" also took up its share of
the wide road, and at the barricades there were
traffic blockades lasting at times for ten
minutes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The road
to Furnes.</div>

<p>All the way from Dunkirk I had been struck
by the character of the land. As I approached
Furnes, the dykes were being opened
and half the fields were already inundated.
It seemed a poor country for military operations.
There were at most three highways, all
defended. They could only be taken at a price
no army could afford, and any departure from
them meant being mired in the heavy fields,
now being hastily harvested of a bumper crop
of sugar-beets: at one place a whole French
regiment in uniform was gathering the beets
preparatory to inundation. With the dykes
open these fields would be covered with four
feet of water half the time. The only possible
course for an army was over the sand-dunes,
which lay a mile to the north, looking like
the imitation mountains you see in the scenic-railways
at every amusement resort in the
United States.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Tommies'
battles
on the
sand-dunes.</div>

<p>A reservist with whom I walked a mile or so
told me Dunkirk had never been successfully
attacked except over those sand-dunes, and the
English and French had fought some of the
bloodiest battles of history there against the
Spanish, when they held Dunkirk. I doubt,
though, that they were as bloody as the battle
I was to see within a few hours.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Belgian
soldiers.</div>

<p>The old Flemish town of Furnes had much
less military precision about it than Dunkirk.
It was on the very edge of the battle, and an
occasional shell was dropping in the town. One
exploded as I crossed the bridge and entered a
narrow street, but it was on the far side of
town, too far away for the soldiers halted in the
street to notice. These were tired and dirty
men, but not too tired to be courteous. They
were also passing jokes among themselves, and
laughing. By that, even if I had not known
their uniforms, I could have told they were
Belgians.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
enemy
held at
the Yser.</div>

<p>Every street and every courtyard in Furnes
was full of Belgian soldiers. They were resting
for the day, waiting to go forward at night-fall
to relieve the men on the firing line only five
miles away. Even above the noises of the street
I could hear the answer of their small field
artillery to the heavy assault of the German
guns. Nothing I heard the soldiers say, however,
would have given the idea that the Belgians
considered themselves outclassed by their
enemy. They seemed superbly unconscious of
the absurdity of their position. This was the
tenth day they had held the Germans at the
Yser, and they had done it with rifles and machine
guns, taking punishment every minute
from the big fieldpieces the Germans had
brought against them. So far they had lost
twelve thousand men at that ditch, but the
thought of giving it up had evidently not even
occurred to them. They could not give it up,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
one of them explained to me later, it was all
they had left. There was a little irritation
in his tone, too, as he said it, such as one might
feel toward a child who was slow at grasping
a simple fact.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Military
automobiles and
wagons.</div>

<p>The town square was full of military automobiles
and a few provision wagons. I did not
see any fieldpieces or machine guns. Every
last one was right up on the firing-line. My feet
were tired from walking over the Belgian
blocks, and I held tenaciously to the sidewalk
passing around the square, though it was
mostly taken up with caf&eacute; tables and bay trees
in boxes. At one point the tables were empty
and a single sentry was sauntering up and
down. I stopped to ask him the way to the
<i>gendarmerie</i>, and, in the middle of giving me
the directions, he came to attention, as a door
opened behind me, and saluted.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Two
Belgian
generals.</div>

<p>Two men came out of the door, one rather
tall, with an easy manner, and smartly dressed
as a general in the Belgian army. The other
was older, also a general, wearing, if anything,
the more gold braid of the two. They entered
a waiting automobile and drove off as casually
as two men at home might leave their office for
their club.</p>

<p>Something about the first of the two men impressed
me as familiar. I had only seen his
back, but that had arrested my attention. I
thought possibly I had seen him at the beginning
of the war in Brussels, so I asked the
sentry his name.</p>

<div class="sidenote">King
Albert.</div>

<p>"That is our king, Albert," he said quite simply.</p>

<p>During the next couple of days I saw the
King of Belgium a number of times. He spent
his nights at a small villa on the seashore at
La Panne, a hundred yards possibly beyond the
hotel where I spent mine. He passed through
the streets as unnoticed as any one of the other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
Belgians who had retreated from Antwerp and
Ghent ahead of the army, but preferred the
chilly nights in an unheated seaside hotel in
Belgium to comfort somewhere beyond. It
seemed to be a point of courtesy on the part of
the Belgians not to bother their king with ceremony
at this trying time. I doubt if he cares
much for ceremony, anyhow. Searching around
for a single adjective to describe him, I should
call him off-handed. His manner, even then,
while alert, was casual. It is easy to see why
the Belgians love him. If kings had always
been as simple and direct as Albert, I am inclined
to think democracy would have languished.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Luncheon
at La
Panne.</div>

<p>At La Panne, which I reached at noon on a
little steam railway running from Furnes, I had
luncheon with several Belgian soldiers and a
Belgian in civilian clothes, who told me I would
see all the fighting I was looking for at Nieuport,
just beyond. The civilian, a tall youth
with a blond beard, volunteered to show me the
way to the beach, the shortest route, and ended
by going all the way. He told me he was
recovering from an "attack of Congo," which I
take to be an intermittent fever. He had just
been mustered out of the civic guard and was
waiting for a uniform to join the army. He
had the afternoon free and his Belgian sense
of hospitality impelled him to see that the
stranger was properly looked after.</p>

<p>For several miles along the wide, flat beach,
which stretches unobstructed as far as Ostend,
except for the piers at Nieuport-les-Bains and
Westende, there were Belgian soldiers bathing
in the shallow water. Some of them, cavalrymen,
were riding naked into the deeper water,
and this, mind you, was late October. They
were even playing jokes on one another, and
did not seem to be paying any attention to the
fifteen English and French cruisers and gunboats<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
which were standing off the shore almost
opposite them, keeping up a steady stream of
fire obliquely along the beach at the sand dunes
just beyond the pier at Nieuport-les-Bains. In
these dunes, <i>five</i> miles away, big German guns
were hidden.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fishermen
unconcerned.</div>

<p>Farther on, and even right up to the pier at
Nieuport, we passed, along the beach behind
the shrimp fishermen, who seemed even less
interested in the novel fight on land and sea.
The barelegged men and women were as industriously
taking advantage of the low-tide
as if nothing at all were happening. The
French and English warships were directly opposite
them, and, by this time, they were drawing
the German fire. German shells, probably
from siege guns, were plumping down into the
water all around them only a couple of miles
off-shore, but, though the shrimpers looked up
occasionally when the explosion of a shell fairly
shook the face of the ocean, their attention
would be directed again to their work before
the column of water raised by the shell had had
time to fall again. The shelling kept up about
an hour, but none of the warships was struck.
They kept moving at full-speed in an uneven
line, making it impossible to get their range.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A panorama
of battle.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Germans
try to
cross the
Yser.</div>

<p>Just before we reached the pier heavy cannonading
began inland. We climbed the sand
dunes and there we came suddenly upon a
perfect panoramic view of the battle all the
way from the dunes across the inundated fields
to Dixmude in the distance. The whole line
of battle for ten miles was in the midst of a
German attack, covered by a terrific artillery
fire. Over the white, red-tiled cottages of the
fishermen, almost lost among the lesser sand
dunes, we could make out the Belgian line
by the fire of their rifle and machine guns. At
two points we could see the Yser Canal and at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
one of these the Germans were trying to throw
across a pontoon bridge.</p>

<p>We could see it only through the smoke of
breaking shells, but it was the most exciting
event I have ever witnessed. At three miles
or more, though, the figures of the men were so
small, it was hard to keep the fact in mind that
those who dropped were not merely stooping,
but had been shot. Eager to get closer, we
ran over the sand dunes, but never got another
view of it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Running
to see a
battle.</div>

<p>My Belgian friend knew his way and we
trotted along a raised path among the fields
toward Nieuport. It was under fire, but it
seemed worth the risk to get close enough so we
could see the pontoons being rushed into the
water. As we neared Nieuport, however, the
firing became much more active and we stopped
for second thought. After catching our breath,
we decided to pass through the edge of Nieuport
and to go on to the village of Ramscapelle
to the south of it. Few shells seemed to be
breaking there.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Almost
under
fire.</div>

<p>Along the cross road we took, alternately
running and walking. The Belgian trenches
were perhaps a half mile beyond us, and we
could make out the tap-tap of the rifle fire
which had been only a continuous cracking a
mile in the rear. Into this the machine guns
cut with a whir. Spent bullets dropped here
and there in the inundated field to the west of
us, but the German shell fire must have been
right in the trenches.</p>

<p>Somewhere before we reached Ramscapelle
we crossed a road with military automobiles
going both ways, but my desire to get behind
the sheltering buildings of Ramscapelle was too
strong at the moment to take it in.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fires and
explosions
in Ramscapelle.</div>

<p>About a hundred yards from the village there
was a house on the edge of a canal, and we
stopped behind it, safe from bullet-fire, to catch<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
our breath again. It was as far as we were
destined to get. All at once shells began dropping
on the village, and I have not seen shells
drop so fast in so small an area. In the first
minute there must have been twenty. Three
fires broke out almost at once. Between the
explosions we could hear the falling tiles.</p>

<p>The short October day grew unexpectedly
dusk and the fires in the village reflected in
the water on the fields. After the bombarding
had been going on without the least let-up for
fully fifteen minutes, a bent old woman, a man
perhaps older but less bent, and a younger
woman appeared on the road to Furnes just
beyond us, hurrying along without once looking
back. They were the only people we saw and
the destruction of the town looked like the
most ruthless piece of vandalism. It had a
military purpose, however. The Germans were
concentrating an attack on it with the hope
of reaching Furnes. They occupied it that
night, but were later driven out again. I have
learned since some of the villagers remained
through that bombardment, and were killed in
their houses.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Destruction of
Ramscapelle.</div>

<p>While we stood sheltered by the house on
the canal, speculating as to which one of the
houses still standing in Ramscapelle would be
hit next, the light from those on fire reflected
on the dark, brackish water of the canal, which
was running in with the tide. Presently we
noticed something in the water, and, stooping
down in the twilight, we made out the body of
a man face downward. The color of the coat
and the little short skirt to it showed it was
the body of a German soldier. It passed on
and was followed by three more before we left.
They had been in the water several days.</p>

<p>The fire from the trenches died down at dusk
and we made our way back along the empty
crossroad. Half way back to the dunes we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
passed a Red Cross motor ambulance, headed
toward Ramscapelle. On the seat beside the
driver was a young English woman. She was
wearing the gray-brown coat and gray-brown
puttees of the English soldier. We called out
to her we thought the town was empty, but the
only answer we got from the speeding ambulance
was an assuring wave of the young woman's
hand, which was evidently meant to inform
us she knew where she was going.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ambulances and
infantry
pass.</div>

<p>On the main road from Nieuport to Furnes,
which we followed a short distance, there were
dozens of ambulances going to the rear and a
long column of infantry going forward. Headed
toward the rear there were also many wounded
men on foot. They had been dressed at Nieuport,
but there were not enough ambulances
to take them all away. One who was walking
slowly and painfully told me he had a bullet
in his back.</p>

<p>During the afternoon the Schneiders I had
seen had evidently been placed among the sand
dunes, and they were now bombarding the
German lines over our heads. Crossing over
the sand dunes to the beach, we passed under
two batteries, though we did not see them.
We could tell they were French, though, by the
rapidity of the fire. The French seem to be
able to fire their guns several times as fast as
the Germans or the English.</p>

<p>A cluster of houses belonging to shrimp
fishermen was right under these batteries,
where they were sure to get some of the return
fire. But we noticed there were lights in every
one of the cottages. Inside were the same
fishermen who were so apathetic about the
fight off-shore.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Battle
of the
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'sand-dunes'">sand dunes</ins>.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Red
flashing
of the
contact
shells.</div>

<p>The view from the sand dunes was what the
war artists on English illustrated weeklies try
so hard to show. The French batteries were
using shrapnel on the German trenches, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
shrapnel leaving puffs of white smoke in long,
uneven lines; and the Germans were keeping
up their steady pounding of contact shells,
with a short red flash after each explosion.
The firing of the guns on both sides gave the
effect of continuous summer lightning.</p>

<p>Into the panorama the fleet off-shore kept
up a new attack on the German batteries in
the sand dunes just beyond Nieuport-les-Bains.
As it was dark now we could see where they
were only by the streaks of fire from their guns.
These flashes came and went like the strokes
of a dagger, as if they were stabbing the
dark.</p>

<div class="sidenote">French
soldiers.</div>

<p>We went back along the beach to avoid being
questioned, turning around constantly to
watch the fleet. At Coxyde a whole company
of French soldiers was standing along the edge
of the water, jumping back in surprise when
the little waves advanced on them. They told
us they were from the centre of France and had
never seen salt water before.</p>

<p>The shore there is lined with new villas made
of light colored bricks. One of these had been
dynamited, because it belonged to a German
and was suspected of having a concrete floor
for siege guns. I had heard of cases of this
kind before, but I had never had an opportunity
to examine one.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Concrete
foundations.</div>

<p>My private thought was that the villa had
probably been built by a German with a passion
for solidity, but, examining it under a
half-full moon, I could see the foundations
were brick walls two feet thick covered with
mosaic backed by reinforced concrete about a
foot thick. It seemed like something more
than Teutonic thoroughness.</p>

<p>A little later in La Panne I was shown a
concrete tennis court belonging to a German
which had been punched full of holes. It was
in no place thick enough, however, to give<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
cause for suspicion that its real purpose was
in any way sinister.</p>

<p>By the time we regained La Panne I was
hardly able to walk as I had been going hard
all day, a good deal of the way through soft
sand. But even if I had been much more tired
I would have sensed the atmosphere of that
town. To me the little seaside village, built
for summer gayety, had more of the romance
of war in it than any place I have seen.</p>

<p>The half dozen summer hotels and all the
villas were filled with the mothers, wives, and
children of the Belgian soldiers whose firing
line I had just left. Their homes had been in
Brussels, Antwerp, Ghent. Now they were
in the last little town in Belgium. To some
their soldiers had already returned, and they
were dining as merrily as if to-morrow did not
hold out a reasonable likelihood of being killed.
At the doors of the hotels and on the street
were many others waiting, and, as the street had
filled up with another French artillery division
bivouacked for a few hours, they could not
see their men folk until they were close at
hand.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Refugees
at La
Panne.</div>

<p>Now and then as we passed we could hear
little gasps of happiness. For some, of
course, there were disappointment and bad
news. But they must have carried their sorrow
to their chambers, as La Panne was all
gayety.</p>

<p>A comment on the Belgian soldiers made at
the beginning of the war occurred to me:
"They shoot the enemy all day; at night they
come home and kiss mother. In the morning
they kiss mother again and go back to shoot
some more."</p>

<p>They certainly showed themselves capable
of shaking off the horrors of war before their
women folk. To see them there in La Panne
that night you might have thought it was all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
a sham battle if it had not been for a conviction
of reality that would not shake off.</p>

<p>It was nearly ten o'clock, now but Belgian
soldiers relieved from the firing line and off
duty for the night were still coming into La
Panne. In the Hotel Des Arcades, which incidentally,
has no arcades, the bar and the dining
room were full of soldiers. Officers and
their men were eating and drinking together
in the pleasant democratic way they have in
the Belgian army. Room was made for us at
the long central table in the dining room, and
all at the table were solicitous to see that we
were at once given plenty to eat and drink.
Several of the fifteen men at the table had
hands or heads bandaged, but that did not
seem to detract from their gayety.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Spirit
of the
Belgian
soldiers.</div>

<p>A joke was being told as we sat down, and
every one was taking a lively interest in it,
the narrator was a bearded man of fifty, and
he was telling to the delight of the others how
his son had once got the better of him in Brussels
before the war. There were other stories
of matters equally foreign to war. The private
on one side of me told me he was the manager
for Belgium of an American typewriter. The
lieutenant on the other side was in ordinary
times an insurance agent. All the men
there were in business and talked and acted
like a company of young American business
men.</p>

<p>My first hint that these men had been through
any trying experience was the apology offered
by a new-comer for being late. He entered
rather gravely and said something about having
to take the word to his sister of his brother-in-law's
death. The whole company turned
grave then and conversation from being general
was carried on for a few minutes between
those near together. I asked the typewriter
agent, to fill an awkward pause, whether they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
had seen much action, and he told me their
story.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The fight
on the
road to
Nieuport.</div>

<p>This was a crack mitrailleuse company of
Brussels. It had been in the fight from Li&egrave;ge
back to Malines and from Antwerp back to
Dixmude and Nieuport. Three days before it
was told to hold a road into Nieuport. It was
a road the Germans must take, if they were
to advance, but the Belgians would not give
way. They were too clever with their rapid-fire
guns to be rushed, and the German bayonet
charges only blocked the road with their dead.
Again and again the gray line came on, but
each time it crumpled before their fire. They
were attacked every hour of the day or night,
but they were always ready. Finally the Germans
got their range and dropped shell after
shell right among them.</p>

<p>"They blew us all to pieces," the story went
on in a low tone at my elbow. "Those shells
don't leave many wounded, but they littered
the place with arms and legs. They got a
good many of us, but they did not seem to be
able to get our guns."</p>

<p>I asked what their loss had been, and he
looked around the table, counting, before he
answered.</p>

<p>"Let's see, now," he said. "We lost some at
Dixmude first. I think there were just seventy
last Monday." This was Thursday. "We had
a pretty bad time," he ended; looking down.</p>

<p>"How many are there now?" I asked, and
he answered with a sweep of his hand around
the table. "Five or six more," he said. There
were eighteen of them at table now. That
meant twenty-three or twenty-four&mdash;out of seventy.</p>

<p>"The dogs suffered, too," he added. "We've
only got eight out of twenty, and I just heard
the dogs around here have already been pressed
into service."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Courtesy

gunners.</div>

<p>When I went to bed four of the members
of that shattered mitrailleuse company climbed
three flights of stairs to see that I had a comfortable
room. And these men had just come
out of a trench where they had lost more than
two thirds their number in three days stopping
one of the main lines of the German advance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Back to
the lines.</div>

<p>In the twilight of early morning, when the
cannonading had at last died down, I heard the
movement of troops in the street and saw my
friends of the night before falling into line and
getting their equipment straight. By the time
I reach the sidewalk they were moving off,
some of the men helping the dogs with the
mitrailleuse.</p>

<p>"Big fight last night," said the typewriter
agent smiling. "Company that relieved us got
it hard. We must hurry back."</p>

<p>They were all very alert and soldierlike in
the chill of the morning, but they were a pitifully
small company as they passed up the
road and were lost in the sand dunes.</p>

<p>In August and September, while on the western
front were being fought the great initial
struggles of the Great War, Turkey, long under
German political influence, was making
ready to cast her lot with the Teutonic Powers.
Germany had already made diplomatic and
military moves which indicated that she was
certain of a Turkish alliance. The strongest
figures of the Ottoman Empire, Enver Pasha
and Talaat Bey were strongly pro-German, although
the latter endeavored for a time to conceal
his real sentiments and intentions under
a cloak of pretended neutrality. The causes
which induced Turkey to side with the Central
Powers rather than with the Allies <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'is'">are</ins> explained

<h2>WHY TURKEY ENTERED<br />
THE WAR</h2>

<h3>ROLAND G. USHER</h3>


<div class="sidenote">Extreme
danger of
Turkey.</div>

<p>Many people entirely misunderstand the
significance of the declaration of war by
Turkey against Russia, France, and England.
Why these despairing gasps of the dying?
they ask. What possible chance has this
weak, moribund state to survive a clash of arms
with the Triple Entente? Has not the Turk, in
fact, dug his own grave and committed suicide?
In all probability the Turk is in considerable
danger, but the danger does not arise from his
joining Germany. In fact, the war and the
present international situation provide the
Turk with the best opportunity in a century to
achieve the aims cherished by Turkish statesmen
who have the best interests of Turkey
itself at heart. For several years Turkey has
been in extreme peril. It was condemned to
death by the Triple Entente some time ago,
and the prediction of the British Prime Minister
in a recent public speech that this war
would end the existence of Turkey as an independent
power was only the publication of
the sentence of death long since decided upon.
The Sick Man was kept alive by his friends, the
doctors, largely because they deemed his malady
incurable. The moment he showed signs of
convalescence they agreed to poison him. But
for the protection of Germany the political
existence of Turkey would be already a thing
of the past. The Turk, therefore, will stand or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
fall according to the decision in this war for
or against Germany. He will be excessively
foolish not to do everything he can to insure a
German victory.</p>



<div class="sidenote">Entrance
of Turkey
into War.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Constantinople
core
of the
War.</div>

<p>The entrance of Turkey into the war has long
been foreseen, and its vast significance has long
been clear to students. Some trained observers
go much further: Sir Harry Johnston, a
traveler, statesman, and diplomat of repute,
has declared: "Constantinople is really the
core of the war." In diplomatic circles in
Vienna this summer there was a general agreement
that the loss of Salonika, which the Turk
was forced to hand over to Greece at the end
of the Balkan wars, was a vital blow to the
Triple Alliance, and its recovery would be of
sufficient importance to justify the risk of a
European war to accomplish it. The situation
in the Near East and in the Balkans is an
integral part of the European war. In fact, the
war is not a European war at all; it is a world
war in the most literal sense of the words.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Control of
exit from
the Black
Sea imperative
to Russia.</div>

<p>At the beginning of the twentieth century
keen observers saw clearly that the old order of
things, which had preserved the Turk so long
in the face of many enemies, had passed away
beyond a peradventure and had left the Turk
in great peril. Ever since the decay of the
strength of the Ottoman Empire the Turk had
been hardly pressed in Europe by Russia and
by Austria, both of whom coveted sections of
his dominions, and both of whom would have
been glad to obtain Constantinople, the gateway
between Europe and Asia. Of the two,
Russia was more insistent because her interests
made the control of the exit from the Black Sea
imperative for her. The Turk, however, until
very recently, was himself strong enough to
throw considerable obstacles in the face of the
invader; he was probably, in 1900, more efficient
than in 1850; but his enemies had grown by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
leaps and bounds. He was confronted by a
new Austria and a new Russia.</p>

<p>What was worse, the Balkan nations, who
had long been subject peoples, ill-organized,
poverty stricken, had grown with the help of
the Turk's enemies into sturdy, self-reliant, independent
communities with good-sized armies
and something approaching national wealth.
The long years of subjection had left behind
a consuming hatred of the Turk in their
breasts; as Christians, they hated the Turk as
the Infidel; and they promised themselves some
day the control of Constantinople in the interest
of Christianity. The neighbors of the Turk
had grown formidable and would be able to
make short work of him unless help arrived.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Industrial
growth of
Germany.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Old order
changes.</div>

<p>There was none to be had from his past
friends; so much was only too clear. The shift
in the international situation caused by the
astounding industrial growth of Germany, the
rapid development of the German, Austrian,
and Italian fleets, the increased efficiency of the
armies of the Triple Alliance had all made the
control of the Mediterranean far more difficult
for England and France. They could no longer
spare ships and troops in sufficient numbers
to rescue the Turk from Russia without exposing
themselves more than was wise in northern
Europe. Besides, the designs of the Triple
Alliance made it seem only too probable that
the possession of Constantinople by Russia and
the creation of a fleet in the Black Sea might
be the only means of preserving for the French
and English control of the western Mediterranean.
The old order had changed: the
Turk's friends were now his enemies bent on
his destruction.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ambition
of new
Turkish
party.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Democratic
and
nationalist
revival.</div>

<p>Yet there had never been a time when the
Sick Man was more desperately determined to
get well, when life had seemed to him so entirely
desirable. The passing of the old order<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
caused no grief among the Turks&mdash;outside of
those few henchmen who had long drawn a
fat revenue from foreign nations. The Turks
had become fired with ambition, with democratic
conceptions, highly inconsistent with the
state of things which the old order had so long
sanctioned. The new democrats declared indignantly
that Turkey had been for years conducted
for the benefit of foreign nations; it
should be conducted in the future solely in the
interests of Turkey. They were roused to enthusiasm
by the past history of the Ottoman
empire and burned to reconquer its old
provinces, to establish a closer relationship between
the provinces which remained. An imperialistic
movement, a nationalistic revival,
if you will, was preached in Turkey by ardent
enthusiasts whose words fell on willing ears.
To the democratic and nationalist revival was
joined religious discontent. The Sultan was
the religious head of the Mohammedan world.
Everywhere the true Believers were in chains.
Everywhere the infidel reigned supreme. From
Constantinople to Mecca, from the confines of
Morocco to the plains of India, the Mohammedan
world was ground under the heel of the
conqueror and the conqueror was the Arch
Enemy of Truth. There must be, they preached,
a great crusade, a united rising to cast out the
Christian dogs and restore the sceptre of empire
to the hand of a devout believer in Allah.
Turkey, Assyria, Asia Minor, Persia, Arabia,
India, Egypt, the whole of Africa, should be
freed from the yoke of the oppressor.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Great
Confederation
of
States.</div>

<div class="sidenote">From
Berlin to
Bagdad
railroad.</div>

<p>And now appeared an ally, unfortunately a
Christian, in fact a peculiarly devout Christian,
but one able to save the Turk from his foes,
glad to foster his ambitions. The plans of Germany
for her future involved the creation of a
great confederation of states stretching from
the North Sea to the Persian Gulf and including<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
Holland, Belgium, Denmark, Germany,
Austria, Switzerland, the Balkans, Turkey, and
Persia. These states controlled the great overland
roads from central Europe to the Persian
Gulf and would make possible overland trade
with the East. A railroad already existed as
far as Constantinople, and a railroad from
Constantinople to Bagdad and the Gulf would
not only throw open Asia Minor and the great
plains of Mesopotamia to European capital,
but would furnish a perfectly practicable commercial
road to the East through which in time
would flow a trade which would make the great
Confederation rich. Of this Confederation,
Turkey would be an integral and essential part.
Adrianople, the key to the Balkans; Salonika,
key to the &AElig;gean; Constantinople, controlling
the outlet to the Black Sea and the crossing to
Asia Minor; the land approaches of the Tigris
and Euphrates valleys&mdash;all these the Turk had,
all these an alliance with him would give Germany.
The stronger the Turkish State, the
better organized, the larger its army and fleet,
the greater its resources, the more useful it
would be to Germany and the more thoroughly
it would insure the success of Pan-Germanism.</p>

<div class="sidenote">England
and
France
sustain
courteous
hold on
Constantinople.</div>

<p>It had been for the interests of England and
France to keep Turkey weak. The Turk must
hold Constantinople, but must not be strong
enough to use it; as a tenant, as a nominal
owner, he was extremely useful; some one had
to own it; England and France could not hold
it themselves; they were determined Russia
should not have it; and the Turk was a useful
<i>locum tenens</i>. They, therefore, frowned upon
Turkish ambitions for democratic government
and would, undoubtedly, have sacrificed the
Turk rather than see an independent Mohammedan
State take real control of Asia Minor
and Northern Africa.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pan-Germanic
Confederation.</div>

<p>Germany, on the contrary, wished an active<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
agent to pursue an aggressive policy in her
favor. If the Sick Man could get out of bed
only with assistance, Germany was anxious to
help him; and the Turk vastly preferred an alliance
with a Power which was eager to make
him well to one with Powers almost afraid to
keep him alive. The Turks wished a capable
government, a good army, a State deserving
of independence, and were overjoyed to find
Germany ready and desirous to foster this ambition.
Indeed, as a member of the Pan-Germanic
Confederation, the Turk must be strong
enough to hold Constantinople and the Bagdad
Railway in the event of a general European
war, without depending upon Germany for
more than assistance, supplies, and advice.
Germany and Austria, menaced on both sides
at home, would not be able to take the risks of
sending troops to the Near East, and the Turk
would have to be strong enough to keep at bay
such forces as it seemed likely Russia would
be able to spare from the battlefields of northern
Europe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pan-Islam.</div>

<p>Germany was equally ready to have the Turk
gratify his imperialist and religious ambitions.
Pan-Islam would destroy the political control
of England and France in northern Africa and
in Egypt. It might even overturn the British
Empire in India. This would be the greatest
possible service any one could render Germany,
and it might be one which Germany could accomplish
in no other way. If the Triple Entente
was the greatest foe of Pan-Islamism,
Pan-Germanism should be its greatest friend.
Where ambition and interest coincide, co-operation
is simple.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Reorganization
of
Turkey.</div>

<p>In complete accord, therefore, the Germans
and the Turks undertook the reorganization of
Turkey above five years or more ago. They
saw with clear vision the real truth about Turkey.
With engaging candor they laid the blame<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
for the deficiencies of Turkish government upon
England and France and declared them the
work of intention. Turkey, they saw, was not
a nation in the European sense of the word; it
was not even a single race. It was not a geographical
unit by any means, but a series of
districts on the whole geographically disconnected.
Far from being an economic unit with
a single interest vital to all its inhabitants,
it produced nothing essential to the outside
world which its inhabitants could depend upon
exchanging for European manufactured goods.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Turkey's
economic
interests.</div>

<p>Its economic interests were potential rather
than real; its trade, the result of its strategic
position rather than of the interests and the
capacity of its population. Normally and naturally
the Turk should be a middleman, a distributor
rather than a producer. He was
placed in control of the continental roads between
Asia and Central Europe, and was able
to control the overland trade as soon as it
emerged from the Caucasus or the Persian Gulf,
and maintain that control until the continental
highway passed into the defiles of the Balkans
beyond Adrianople. Constantinople itself, controlling
the narrow passage which formed the
exit of the Black Sea, was in a position to foster
or hinder the entire trade of southern Russia
with the rest of the world. In fact, it was impossible
to deny, and the Germans thoroughly
well understood it, that the trade of the East
with Europe and the trade of Russia with the
rest of the world might pass through Turkey,
but was not likely to stay there.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Turkey's
important
strategic
position.</div>

<p>In this important strategic position, economically
valuable to others but not to its inhabitants,
had been collected a peculiar and extraordinary
conglomeration of races, creeds, and
interests; few of which had much in common,
and all of which cherished for each other antipathies
and jealousies almost as old as history.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
The racial problem of Turkey would be less
difficult if the races were only located side by
side in solid masses. With few exceptions the
races interpenetrate one another to a remarkable
extent and the Turk himself is numerically
in the majority in comparatively few districts
of Asia Minor, where the bulk of the Turkish
population lives, and in scarcely any part of
European Turkey. The Turks are literally
overlords, a ruling class.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Turkey's
weak
political
fabric.</div>

<p>The Turk has governed this vast territory
and this conglomeration of races and religions
by a peculiarly weak political fabric which
seemed in the nineteenth century to combine in
one structure all the disadvantages of centralization,
and all those of decentralization.
Subject peoples have been ruled by a combination
of military, civil, and religious authority
which has been dependent in the long run for
its support on the army. However, had the subject
peoples hated each other less cordially, had
they been more capable of organization and
willing to compromise, they might have ended
the Turkish rule decades ago, army or no army.
Some observers, indeed, have thought the Turkish
Government an artificial sham kept alive
by France and England for their own purposes.
Whatever reasons were to be given, the Germans
and the Turks saw that Turkey as a nation
and Turkey as a state had been, both of
them, practically non-existent. Both had been
names, not realities. Turkey had appeared on
the European maps. A series of so-called
statesmen had taken European bribes in Constantinople;
numerous incompetent and venal
officials had robbed the populace with the help
of the soldiers in the provinces, and this Government
plus the army was Turkey. Turkey had,
indeed, been sick, but that particular kind of
illness, the Turks thought, could be cured; and
the Germans agreed with them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Germany's
willingness
to
assist
Turkey.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Germany's
influence
in Turkey.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Reasons
for
Turkey's
joining
Germany.</div>

<p>We must not forget as observers the exceeding
importance of German willingness to assist
the ambitions of the educated Turks for self-government
and for independence from European
influence. The English and French control
of Turkey was fortuitous and artificial and
depended solely upon the control of a little
group of men in Constantinople. German influence
in Turkey has deep and fundamental
roots in a large and significant part of the
Turkish population and appeals to their best
and highest impulses. We have here in the last
analysis the reasons why Turkey has joined
Germany in the war. The enlightened Turks
see in Pan-Germanism a democratic Turkey
with constitutional self-government, a Turkey
developing its own resources, a Turkey gradually
freeing itself from the fetters of European
alliances and becoming gradually but certainly
strong enough to take its place in the Pan-Germanic
chain as a state of worth, integrity,
and importance. They see in the victory of
Pan-Germanism the effective promise of the
realization of such ideals. They see in the defeat
of Pan-Germanism political and national
death, the annexation of Turkey by its enemies,
and the subjection of the Turks to the rule of
the Infidel. For these reasons they joined
Germany in the first place. For these deep,
fundamental reasons they hold staunchly to
their friend. We shall be guilty of quibbling
and of shortsightedness if we look for an explanation
of Turkish policy in the seizure of
warships and the breach of treaties.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Reorganization
of
Turkey.</div>

<p>The reorganization of Turkey was duly observed
by the Triple Entente and its purpose
thoroughly well understood. Their opposition
to it was prompt, and Italy attempted by the
Tripolitan War to rob the Turk of one of his
distant provinces. Having seized Tripoli with
the consent of the Triple Entente, Italy then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
changed sides, returned to the Triple Alliance
and took Tripoli with her. The result was a
prompt reversal of the strategic situation in the
Eastern Mediterranean and placed England
and France in such danger that they saw the
moment had probably come when it would be
positively to their advantage to gratify Russia's
ambition and allow her to seize Constantinople.
The Tripolitan War suspended the sword of
Damocles over the Turk's head.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Balkan
War.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The
loss of
Macedonia.</div>

<p>The Balkan War threatened for a time to
annihilate him. The prompt aid of Austria
and Germany as stout representatives in the
international conclave, the mobilization of the
Austrian army, the knowledge that Germany
was ready to mobilize, saved the Turk. The
ambitions of Bulgaria brought her over to the
side of the Triple Alliance, which was more
than ready to assist her in dominating the
Balkans. The second war cost Bulgaria dear
but gave back to the Turk Adrianople. Macedonia,
however, was lost entirely, and much of
Thrace, with Salonika, the key of the &AElig;gean,
was also lost and fell into the hands of the
Turk's enemy, Greece.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Little
likelihood
of attack
on Constantinople.</div>

<p>The reorganized state was now undeniably in
great peril; and the probability of an outbreak
of a European war in the near future, the
knowledge that the Turk must himself defend
Constantinople and the Bagdad Railway, urged
the Germans and the Turks to great efforts in
reorganizing the army and providing equipment.
The fleet also received attention; two
battleships were building in England and another
was purchased from one of the South
American states. There would this time be no
escape. The death sentence had been passed
upon the Turk, and if he waited for his enemies
to gather and descend upon him defense would
be problematical. It was, of course, realized
that in the long run Germany would save<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
Turkey by battles won in France or in Poland,
and also that German defeats in Europe would
in the long run spell the downfall of Turkey
whatever the Turk did. It was, therefore, advisable
to postpone action as long as possible.
While Russia was exerting herself to the utmost
to mobilize an army in Poland, there was
small likelihood of an attack on Constantinople,
and the Turk might well remain neutral,
equip and organize the army, acquire supplies,
and choose the moment to take the
offensive.</p>

<div class="sidenote">German
cruisers
at Constantinople.</div>

<p>England, on the outbreak of the war, seized
the two battleships building in England, and,
therefore, weakened the Turkish strength in the
Black Sea. The deficiency was supplied by
sending two German cruisers to Constantinople
and selling them to the Turkish Government.
Some weeks ago the Germans judged that the
time had come when the Turk must openly join
in the war, send his troops to the frontier in
order to hold the invader as far as possible
from Constantinople. Indeed, action at this
time might allow the Turk to accomplish results
of the utmost importance. Those who see
simply the fact that Russia could easily overwhelm
the Turk standing alone, that the Balkan
States united might also dispose of him,
entirely fail to grasp the possibilities before the
Turk at the present moment when Russia is
extremely busy in the North, when the Balkan
States seem hopelessly divided, and when Italy
is maintaining with determination her neutrality.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Closing

<div class="sidenote">Enormous
value

supplies
in the
Black Sea
District.</div>

<p>The most important thing the Turk has done
for Germany has been the closing of the Black
Sea. The sowing of a few mines in the Straits
promptly put an end to Russian trade from the
Black Sea and dealt southern Russia a great
blow commercially. Germany thus struck at
England, because a large part of the English<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
food supply has normally come from the Black
Sea district, and the desire to protect the grain
ships through the Mediterranean has been one
of England's chief reasons for maintaining control
of that sea. So large were these supplies
normally that England has had considerable
difficulty in replacing them and is destined
soon to experience greater difficulty in furnishing
a supply equivalent in volume and accessibility.
The Black Sea district also has large
oil supplies which would be of enormous value
to England and France, now that the extensive
use of the automobile in warfare has made
gasolene a supply second in importance only
to powder and food. If the Turkish navy, augmented
by the German cruisers, can dispose
of the Russian ships in the Black Sea, and this
seems not improbable, the Turk might annex
for Germany this supply of oil. That would be
a stroke of the utmost consequence.</p>

Turkey to
Germany.</div>

<p>Closing the Black Sea by the Turk, plus the
closing of the Baltic by the German fleet in the
North Sea, would also accomplish another extremely
important result, the absolute and complete
isolation of Russia from contact with all
parts of the world except Germany, Austria,
and Turkey. The question has often arisen as
to the ability of Germany to prolong the war in
the face of her inability to export goods to her
usual customers. The complete cessation of
manufacture in Germany would sooner or later
bankrupt the country and bring her to <ins title="Transcriber's Note: this word not present in original text">her</ins> knees.
The Germans point out that the isolation of
Russia will have precisely the same effect on
that country unless Russia can find some place
where her raw products can be exchanged for
the manufactured goods which are much more
necessary in warfare than the crude products
which she always has to sell. The experience
of the past has proved again and again that
belligerent countries persistently trade with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
one another when it is profitable. The Germans
expect to sell their manufactured goods in Russia
in exchange for the raw materials which
Russia produces, just as long as their fleet
holds the mouth of the Baltic and the Turk
controls Constantinople. A brisk trade between
Germany, Austria, and Russia is already
reported and if it attains the proportions the
Germans expect, their commercial problem
will have been largely solved. But its continued
solution will depend upon the maintaining
of Turkey in Constantinople. If these considerations
are as important as the Pan-Germanists
have usually claimed, it will be obvious
that the adhesion of the Turk has exceeding
importance for Germany and had long been arranged
in advance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Control
of the
Suez
Canal
vital to
Great
Britain.</div>

<p>The possibilities before the Turkish army,
well equipped with modern munitions of war
and capably officered by Germans, have been
by no means forgotten. The great objective
of Pan-Germanism is not in Europe but in Asia
and Africa. The defense of the English and
French dominions in both will have to be made
in Europe. The strength of the German army,
the size of the German fleet, would prevent the
English and French from dissipating their
forces over the vast territory which they claim
to control. The experienced troops in India,
in Egypt, and in Morocco were shipped to
France upon the outbreak of the war exactly
as the Germans expected and hoped. Their
places were filled by less experienced regiments
from France, England, and the English colonies.
Egypt and the Suez Canal, India, and
the great defenses would not be so <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'strongely'">strongly</ins>
held. The Turk occupied a position flanking
Persia and a position flanking Egypt. A
strong, well-trained Turkish army might conceivably
capture either or both. Assistance
from within might well be expected in both,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
and victory in either would exert a moral effect
upon the war in Europe which would be of
the utmost importance. A few hours' possession
of the Suez Canal, furthermore, would
allow the Germans to obstruct it and effectually
block the approach of England to Australia
and India except by the long road around
Africa. Conceivably this might interfere seriously
with the English food supplies from Australia
and New Zealand, particularly with the
supplies of meat from the latter. This would
be more than usually important in view of the
deficiency of meat supplies in the United States
and Canada, and the length of time necessary
to procure them from the Argentine Republic.
It is by these blows at the food supply that the
Germans expect to make the greatest impression
upon England. Short of actual invasion,
the stoppage of supplies is the only method by
which the Germans can inflict suffering upon
England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Bulgaria
ally of
Germany.</div>

<div class="sidenote">All
Balkan
states
weakened
by Balkan
War.</div>

<p>No one in Berlin or Constantinople has forgotten
the existence of the Balkans. Servian
enmity, Greek hatred for the Turk, are only too
obvious; Bulgaria is believed to be entirely
faithful to the German interests; Roumania
has never been very trustworthy, and has at
times been an ally of both the coalitions in
Europe. The ability of the Turk, of course, to
hold Constantinople and above all to take the
offensive would depend upon the continued
neutrality or alliance of the Balkan States.
Combined, they are amply strong enough to
overrun Turkey in Europe and probably to
invade Asia Minor in force. All the Balkan
States except Roumania&mdash;which is hardly a
Balkan State&mdash;were very much weakened in
men and in resources by the late Balkan wars,
and will probably have considerable difficulty
in obtaining any quantity of supplies from
foreign countries, though we are told of large<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
purchases by the Greeks in the United States.
The fact, however, that the Turk has taken the
offensive against Egypt and Persia makes it
extremely probable that the Balkan hatreds
have offset each other. Bulgaria's existence
probably depends upon Austrian protection.
Roumania is probably afraid to take the field
with Bulgaria, Turkey, Russia, and Austria
against her, while the Greeks and Servians have
still to recover from the recent wars. It is
probable, therefore, that, Bulgaria and Roumania
being neutral, Servia at war with Austria,
Turkey can take from Greece Salonika and
possibly Macedonia. Should the war in Europe
progress favorably for Germany, the attitude
of the Balkan States toward Germany would
be influenced and a scramble would ensue to
join the victor, which would probably result in
the extinction of Servia and Greece and the
strengthening of Bulgaria and Turkey. Naturally,
the Turk would retake the islands in
the &AElig;gean Sea which are now in Italy's
hands.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Turkey's
position if
Germany
wins in
Europe.</div>

<p>Let us suppose that all goes as they hope:
that the Germans win in Europe; that the
Turks and Bulgarians take control of the Balkans;
that the Russians are excluded from
Persia, and the English from Egypt. The
victorious Turkish army is then in a position
to advance along the Persian Gulf road upon
India, and would assail India at her weakest
point, outflanking the great defenses at Quetta
which have been developed primarily against
Russia.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Possibilities
of
Pan-Islam.</div>

<p>We must not forget to enumerate, among the
possibilities, Pan-Islam. Success by the Turks
in Egypt or Persia would undoubtedly give an
impulse to Pan-Islam which might put all the
fanatical enthusiasm of the Mohammedans into
a vast uprising which might sweep the French
and English out of northern Africa and India.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
The Sultan of Turkey is the official head of the
Mohammedan religion. His orders Moslems are
all bound to obey. At present the Mohammedans
in the English and French possessions,
who are, of course, under English and French
influence, are claiming that the acts of the Sultan
are not really his, but those of German
officers; and the reports at the time of writing
indicate that at the present moment the
order from Constantinople for a holy war will
probably not be regarded or obeyed. But a victory
by Turkish arms would probably instantly
change the situation and might loose the pent-up
fanaticism of the most intensely emotional
of the Oriental races. Here is another weapon
in the German arsenal whose use will depend
upon the co&ouml;peration of the Turk.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Key of
situation
is Constantinople.</div>

<p>It should now be evident that there is much
to be said for the view that the key to the present
situation is Constantinople. We are dealing
with world politics, with a world war which
is being fought on the battlefields of Europe;
but we are dealing with a world war whose
results are not expected to develop in Europe
proper. The key to this situation lies in Constantinople,
and the Turk holds it.</p>

<p>The outbreak of the Great War found the
British navy in a high state of preparedness,
and so preponderant in number of vessels and
in weight of guns that the German Grand
Fleet as a whole was content to remain behind
the walls of Helgoland. Squadrons were sent
out, however, to attack isolated British ships,
and on August 28 the first naval battle of the
war occurred in the Bight of Helgoland. Here
British and German cruisers engaged in a
struggle in which the honors were for a time
even. The arrival of British dreadnoughts
quickly turned the scale, and the German ships
fled to the safety of their harbor. The Germans<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
lost four large ships, while the British fleet lost
none.</p>

<p>The German navy was revenged in November
3, when a fleet of warships met and sunk
three British cruisers off the Coronel. On December
9, however, a British fleet, after a search
of many days, came up with and sank three
German cruisers, and severely damaged two
others in the Battle of Falkland Islands.</p>

<h2>THE FALKLAND SEA FIGHT</h2>

<h3>A. N. HILDITCH</h3>


<div class="sidenote">The
Falkland
Islands.</div>

<p>In 1592, John Davis, the arctic explorer,
after whom the strait between Greenland
and the North American mainland is
named, made an attempt, in company with
Thomas Cavendish, to find a new route to Asia
by the Straits of Magellan. Differences arose
between the two leaders. One was an explorer:
the other had a tendency towards freebooting.
They parted off the coast of Patagonia. Davis,
driven out of his course by stormy weather,
found himself among a cluster of unknown and
uninhabited islands, some three hundred miles
east of the Straits of Magellan. This group,
after many changes and vicissitudes, passed
finally into the hands of Great Britain, and became
known as the Falkland Islands.</p>



<div class="sidenote">Climate
surface,
and vegetation.</div>

<p>They consist of two large islands and of
about one hundred islets, rocks, and sandbanks.
The fragments of many wrecks testify to the
dangers of navigation, though masses of giant
seaweed act as buoys for many of the rocks.
So numerous are the penguins, thronging in
battalions the smaller islands and the inland
lagoons, that the governor of the colony is
nicknamed King of the Penguins. As New Zealand
is said to be the most English of British
possessions, the Falklands may perhaps be appropriately
termed the most Scottish. Their
general appearance resembles that of the Outer
Hebrides. Of the population, a large proportion
are of Scottish extraction. The climate
is not unlike that of Scotland. The winters are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
misty and rainy, but not excessively cold.
So violent are the winds that it is said to be impossible
to play tennis or croquet, unless walls
are erected as shelter, while cabbages grown
in the kitchen-gardens of the shepherds, the
only cultivated ground, are at times uprooted
and scattered like straw. The surface, much
of which is bogland, is in some parts mountainous,
and is generally wild and rugged. Small
streams and shallow freshwater tarns abound.
A natural curiosity, regarded with great wonder,
exists in 'stone-rivers'; long, glistening
lines of quartzite rock d&eacute;bris, which, without
the aid of water, slide gradually to lower levels.
There are no roads. Innumerable sheep, the
familiar Cheviots and Southdowns, graze upon
the wild scurvy-grass and sorrel. The colony
is destitute of trees, and possesses but few
shrubs. The one tree that the Islands can
boast, an object of much care and curiosity,
stands in the Governor's garden. The seat of
government, and the only town, is Port Stanley,
with a population of about 950. Its general
aspect recalls a small town of the western highlands
of Scotland. Many of the houses, square,
white-washed, and grey-slated, possess small
greenhouse-porches, gay with fuchsias and
pelargoniums, in pleasing contrast to the prevailing
barrenness. A small cathedral, Christ
Church, and an imposing barracks, generally
occupied by a company of marines, stand in the
midst of the town. The Government House
might be taken for an Orkney or Shetland
manse.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Government.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Prosperity
of the
colony.</div>

<p>The administration of the colony and of its
dependencies is vested in a Governor, aided
by a Colonial Secretary, and by an executive
and a legislative council. The Governor
acts as Chief Justice, and the Colonial Secretary
as Police Magistrate. There is a local
jail, capable of accommodating six offenders at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
a time. Its resources are not stated, however,
to be habitually strained. Education is compulsory:
the Government maintains schools and
travelling teachers. The inhabitants are principally
engaged in sheep-farming and seafaring
industries. The colony is prosperous,
with a trade that of late years has grown with
extraordinary rapidity. The dividends paid by
the Falkland Islands Company might excite
the envy of many a London director. Stanley's
importance has been increased by the erection
of wireless installation; and as a coaling and
refitting station for vessels rounding the Horn,
the harbour, large, safe, and accessible, is of
immense value.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A raid
expected.</div>

<p>To this remote outpost of empire came tidings
of war in August, 1914. Great excitement
and enthusiasm prevailed. News was very
slow in getting through: the mails, usually a
month in transit, became very erratic. But the
colony eagerly undertook a share in the burden
of the Empire; &pound;2,250 was voted towards the
war-chest; &pound;750 was collected on behalf of the
Prince of Wales's Fund. Detached, though
keen, interest changed, however, as the weeks
passed, to intimate alarm. The Governor, Mr.
Allardyce, received a wireless message from the
Admiralty that he must expect a raid. German
cruisers were suspected to be in the neighbourhood.
Never before had the colony known
such bustle and such excitement. They, the
inhabitants of the remote Falklands, were to
play a part in the struggle that was tugging at
the roots of the world's civilization. The exhilaration
of expectancy and of danger broke
suddenly into their uneventful, though not easy,
lives. But there was cause for keen anxiety.
The colonists were, however, reassured for a
time by a visit from three British warships, the
cruisers <i>Good Hope</i>, <i>Monmouth</i>, and <i>Glasgow</i>,
with the armed liner <i>Otranto</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">British
warships

<div class="sidenote">Search for
German
cruisers.</div>

<p>The <i>Good Hope</i> had, at the declaration of
war, been patrolling the Irish coast. She was
ordered to sweep the Atlantic trade routes for
hostile cruisers. She reached the coast of
North America, after many false alarms, stopping
English merchantmen on the way, and
informing the astonished skippers of the war
and of their course in consequence. When forty
miles east of New York, Rear-Admiral Sir
Christopher Cradock came aboard with his
staff, and hoisted his flag. The Admiral turned
southwards, sweeping constantly for the enemy.
Passing through the West Indies, he proceeded
to the coast of Brazil. Here he was joined by
the <i>Glasgow</i>. The <i>Good Hope</i> had picked up
the <i>Monmouth</i> previously. The three ships, accompanied
by the auxiliary cruiser <i>Otranto</i>,
kept a southerly course. The discovery at
Pernambuco of twenty-three German merchantmen
snugly ensconced behind the breakwater,
in neutral harbour, proved very galling. The
Straits of Magellan and the cold Tierra del
Fuego were at length reached. The squadron
was on the scent of three German cruisers, the
<i>Leipzig</i>, <i>Dresden</i>, and <i>N&uuml;rnberg</i>. It was
suspected that they had gone to coal in this
remote corner of the oceans. Their secret and
friendly wireless stations were heard talking
in code. The British made swoops upon wild
and unsurveyed bays and inlets. The land
around was covered with ice and snow, and the
many huge glaciers formed a sight wonderful
to behold. But the search had proved fruitless.
After rounding the Horn several times, the
squadron had turned towards the Falklands.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rumors of
disaster.</div>

<p>The inhabitants could not long rely, however,
upon these powerful guardians. The
squadron, after coaling, departed, again bound
for the Straits of Magellan and the Pacific.
Its strength was certainly adequate to tackle
with success the three German ships believed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
to be in the vicinity. The colony could depend
upon Admiral Cradock to protect it to the best
of his ability. But it was not improbable that
the enemy might evade the patrolling cruisers,
and descend upon the hapless Falklands without
warning. The Governor saw the advisability
of instant preparation. On October 19,
he issued a notice that all women and children
were to leave Stanley. Provisions, stores, and
clothes were hastily removed into the interior,
which was locally termed the 'camp'. The
colony possessed a Volunteer Rifle Company,
some 120 strong, and two nine-pounder field-guns.
Further volunteers were enrolled and
armed. Suddenly, on November 3, an alarming
wireless message was received. The <i>Good
Hope</i> and the <i>Monmouth</i> were reported to have
been sunk off the coast of Chili. It was unsigned.
There was no proof of its authenticity.
But the next day another message followed
from the captain of the <i>Glasgow</i>. The disaster
was confirmed. The <i>Glasgow</i>, in company with
H. M. S. <i>Canopus</i>, was running with all speed
for the Falklands. They were probably being
followed by the victorious Germans. Four days
of acute suspense followed. The situation
seemed critical. The Governor passed several
nights without taking off his clothes, in expectancy
of wireless messages that needed instant
decoding. People slept beside their telephones.
Early in the morning of Sunday,
November 8, the two warships arrived.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
<i>Glasgow</i>
arrives.</div>

<p>The <i>Glasgow</i> was badly damaged. An enormous
hole, three feet by nine feet, gaped in her
side. A shell had wrecked Captain Luce's
cabin, giving off fumes such as rendered unconscious
several men who rushed in to put out the
fire. The vessel had escaped any serious outbreak,
however, and had suffered only four
slight casualties. Warm tributes were paid by
the captain to the cool and disciplined conduct<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
of both officers and men. The <i>Canopus</i> had not
been engaged. But a narrative of the preceding
events may now be appropriate.</p>

<div class="sidenote">German
cruisers in
Pacific.</div>

<p>Vice-Admiral the Graf Maximilian von Spee
was in command, at the outbreak of hostilities,
of the German China fleet stationed at Tsing-tao.
A successor, indeed, had been appointed,
and was on the way to relieve him. But just
before war was declared von Spee and his
squadron steamed off into the open seas. To remain
at Tsing-tao while vastly superior forces
were closing in upon him would be to little purpose.
Commerce raiding offered a field for rendering
valuable service to the Fatherland. The
<i>Emden</i> was dispatched to the southern seas.
The <i>Leipzig</i> and the <i>N&uuml;rnberg</i> proceeded across
the Pacific, and began to prey upon the western
coast of South America. Half the maritime
trade of Chili was carried in English ships.
Many of them might be seized and destroyed at
little risk. The Admiral, with his two remaining
vessels, the <i>Scharnhorst</i> and the <i>Gneisenau</i>,
successfully evaded the hostile fleets for some
time. On September 14 he touched at Apia,
in German Samoa, familiar to readers of Robert
Louis Stevenson. It could be remembered
how, fifteen years before, this colony, shortly
to fall before a New Zealand expeditionary
force, had been a bone of contention between
Great Britain and Germany. Captain Sturdee,
whom von Spee was soon to meet in more
arduous operations, had on that occasion commanded
the British force in the tribal warfare.
Eight days later, on September 22, the two
German cruisers arrived off Papeete, in Tahiti,
one of the loveliest of Pacific islands. A small
disarmed French gunboat lying there was sunk,
and the town was bombarded. The Admiral,
planning a concentration of German ships, then
steamed east across the Pacific. He got into
touch with friendly vessels. By skilful man&#339;uvring<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
he finally brought five warships,
with colliers, together near Valparaiso.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Drake's
exploits.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Search for
cruisers.</div>

<p>The German ships were all of recent construction.
The <i>Scharnhorst</i> and the <i>Gneisenau</i>
were armoured cruisers of 11,600 tons. The
<i>Leipzig</i>, the <i>N&uuml;rnberg</i>, and the <i>Dresden</i> were
light cruisers of about 3,500 tons. The armament
of the larger vessels included eight 8&middot;2-inch
and six 6-inch guns. The smaller relied
upon either ten or twelve 4-inch pieces. Each
ship carried torpedo tubes, and the speed of
each was about twenty-two or twenty-three
knots an hour. The <i>Dresden</i>, however, could go
to twenty-seven knots. The squadron possessed
all-important allies. Several German merchant-marine
companies, notably the Kosmos,
plied along the Chilian coast. The tonnage of
their vessels, indeed, amounted to no less than
half that of the English companies. The advance
of German enterprise in Chili in recent
years had been very marked. Von Spee's great
stumbling-block was coal. The laws of war prevented
him from sending more than three of
his warships into a neutral port at the same
time, from staying there more than twenty-four
hours, from taking more coal than was necessary
to reach the nearest German harbour,
from coaling again for three months at a port
of the same nationality. But if German merchantmen,
hampered by no such restrictions,
could constantly renew his supplies, the difficulty
of fuel could be to some extent met. Provisions
and secret information as to British
movements could also be obtained through the
same source. Such employment of merchantmen,
however, being contrary to international
law, would have to be clandestine. The great
Pacific coast offered numerous harbours and
abundant facilities for being utilized as a base
under such conditions. It showed many historic
precedents for bold and adventurous exploits<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
which could not fail to appeal to an admiral
whose family, ennobled by the Emperor
Charles VI, took pride in its ancient and aristocratic
lineage. The occasion seemed opportune,
moreover, for the accomplishment, by
himself, his officers, and men, of deeds which
should inspire their posterity as British naval
traditions, for lack of other, at present inspired
them. They could recall how, on this
very coast, in 1578-9, Drake, the master raider,
had seized a Spanish treasure-ship off Valdivia,
had descended like a hawk upon Callao, had
pounced upon another great galleon, taking
nearly a million pounds in gold and silver; and
how the intrepid mariner, sailing off into the
unknown ocean, had circumnavigated the globe,
while the furious de Toledo waited, with eleven
warships, in the Straits of Magellan. Why,
indeed, should not the Germans imitate, in the
twentieth century, the deeds of Drake in the
sixteenth? If they preyed ruthlessly upon
English merchantmen, laden with the wealth
of the West, if they made a descent upon the
Falkland Islands, if then they were to disappear
into the wide Pacific, a career of splendid
adventure and of unbounded usefulness
would earn for them both the respect and the
plaudits of the world. Australian and Japanese
warships were sweeping the eastern
Pacific for them. Many British vessels, called
from useful employment elsewhere, would have
to join in the search for them. But so vast was
the area that they might elude their enemies
for months.</p>

<p>British ships were already cruising near the
Horn, possibly unaware that a concentration
of the Germans had been effected. It was
not unlikely that von Spee might be able to
cut off and to destroy stray units of the
patrolling squadrons. The Graf could see
many opportunities of serving effectively the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
cause of the Fatherland. He must utilize them
to the full.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cradock

coast of
Chili.</div>

<div class="sidenote">German
cruisers
sighted.</div>

<p>Sir Christopher Cradock, meanwhile, had
rounded the Horn once more, and was cruising
northwards up the coast of Chili. That coast,
indeed, once the haunt of corsairs and filibusters,
was rich in historic associations and in
natural beauties. An element of grandeur and
of mystery seemed to hover around the countless
ridges and peaks of the Andes, stretching,
with the gleam of their eternal snows, for four
thousand miles, and gazing down across the
illimitable waters of the occident. Upon the
plateaux, miles above sea level, stood old stone
temples and pyramids which rivalled in massiveness
and ingenuity those of Egypt and of
Babylon. The student of ancient civilizations
could trace, in the mystic deities of the Incas
and Araucanians, a strange similarity to the
deities of the Chaldeans and Babylonians.
Speculation upon this analogy formed a fascinating
theme. This coast, too, was sacred
to memories that could not but be dear to
sailors as gallant and daring as Cradock, since
his services in China, in 1900, was known to
be. Among other familiar British names,
Cochrane, Lord Dundonald, had won enduring
glory in the struggle for Chilian independence,
nearly a hundred years before. The conditions
of naval warfare had, indeed, through the introduction
of armour and the perfection of
weapons, radically changed since Cochrane, in
a series of singularly audacious exploits, had
overcome the fleets of Spain. Sea-fighting had
become purely a matter of science. The object
of strategy was to concentrate faster ships
and more powerful guns against weaker force.
The odds with which Cradock was to contend
against the Germans were greater in proportion,
if less in bulk, than the odds with which
Cochrane had contended, with his peasant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
crews and his hulks, against the Spanish
"wooden-walls". Admiral Cradock now knew
that there were two more cruisers in the neighbourhood
than had at first been supposed. The
<i>Canopus</i> had accordingly been sent to join his
squadron. But she was a battleship, and much
slower than the cruisers. She could travel no
faster than at eighteen knots. Cradock proceeded
northwards, ahead of the <i>Canopus</i>, made
a rendezvous off Concepcion Bay for his colliers,
and went into Coronel and on to Valparaiso
to pick up news and receive letters. The
squadron then returned to the rendezvous and
coaled. This completed, the Admiral directed
the <i>Glasgow</i> to proceed again to Coronel to dispatch
certain cables. Captain Luce duly carried
out his mission, and left Coronel at nine
o'clock on Sunday morning, November 1, steaming
northwards to rejoin the other ships. A
gale was rising. The wind was blowing strongly
from the south. Heavy seas continually
buffeted the vessel. At two o'clock a wireless
signal was received from the <i>Good Hope</i>. Apparently
from wireless calls there was an enemy
ship to northward. The squadron must
spread out in line, proceeding in a direction
north-east-by-east, the flagship forming one extremity,
the <i>Glasgow</i> the other. It was to move
at fifteen knots. At twenty minutes past four
in the afternoon, smoke was observed upon the
horizon. The <i>Glasgow</i> put on speed and approached.
Officers soon made out the funnels
of four cruisers. It was the enemy. The Germans,
their big armoured cruisers leading, and
the smaller behind, gave chase.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
squadrons
approach.</div>

<p>The <i>Glasgow</i> swept round to northward, calling
to the flagship with her wireless. Von Spee,
anticipating this move, at once set his wireless
in operation, in order to jamb the British
signals. Captain Luce soon picked up the
<i>Monmouth</i> and the <i>Otranto</i>, and the three ships<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
raced northwards towards the flagship, the
<i>Glasgow</i> leading. At about five o'clock the
<i>Good Hope</i> was seen approaching. The three
ships wheeled into line behind her, and the
whole squadron now proceeded south. Von
Spee, coming up from that direction in line
ahead, about twelve miles off, changed his
course and also proceeded south, keeping
nearer to the coast. The wind was now blowing
almost with the force of a hurricane. So
heavy was the sea that small boats would have
been unable to keep afloat. But the sky was
not completely overcast, and the sun was shining.
Firing had not opened. The washing of
the seas and the roaring of the wind deafened
the ear to other sounds. The warship of to-day,
when her great turbines are whirling round at
their highest speed, moves without throb and
almost without vibration through the waves.
The two squadrons, drawing level, the Germans
nearer to the coast, raced in the teeth
of the gale, in two parallel lines, to the
south.</p>

<p>Sir Christopher Cradock could not but realize
that the situation was hazardous. He had
three vessels capable of fighting men-of-war.
The <i>Otranto</i> was only an armed liner, and must
withdraw when the battle developed. The <i>Good
Hope</i> displaced some 14,000 tons, and was
armed with two 9'2-inch and sixteen 6-inch
guns. The <i>Monmouth</i>, with a tonnage of 9,800,
carried fourteen 6-inch pieces, but the <i>Glasgow</i>,
a ship of 4,800 tons, had only two of the 6-inch
weapons. It was certain that the German
8&middot;2-inch guns, if the shooting was at all good,
would be found to outrange and outclass the
British. Cradock was certainly at a disadvantage
in gun-power. His protective armour
was weaker than that of the enemy. Nor did
his speed give him any superiority. Though
the <i>Glasgow</i> was capable of twenty-six knots,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
the flagship and the <i>Monmouth</i> could only go
to twenty-three. But there was another consideration
which the Admiral might weigh.
Coming slowly up from the south, but probably
still a considerable distance off, was the
battleship <i>Canopus</i>. Her presence would give
the British a decided preponderance. She was
a vessel of some 13,000 tons, and her armament
included four 12-inch and twelve 6-inch pieces.
How far was she away? How soon could she
arrive upon the scene? Evening was closing
in. Cradock was steering hard in her direction.
If the British, engaging the enemy immediately,
could keep them in play throughout
the night, when firing must necessarily be desultory,
perhaps morning would bring the
<i>Canopus</i> hastening into the action. It was
possible that the Germans did not know of her
proximity. They might, accepting the contest,
and expecting to cripple the British next morning
at their leisure, find themselves trapped.
But in any case they should not be allowed to
proceed without some such attempt being made
to destroy them. It must not be said that, because
the enemy was in greater force, a British
squadron had taken to flight. Perhaps it would
be better, since darkness would afford little
opportunity of man&#339;uvring for action, to draw
nearer and to engage fairly soon. It was about
a quarter past six. The Germans were about
15,000 yards distant. Cradock ordered the
speed of his squadron to seventeen knots. He
then signalled by wireless to the <i>Canopus</i>, 'I
am going to attack enemy now'.</p>

<div class="sidenote">At closer
range.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Only gun

<div class="sidenote">The <i>Good Hope</i>
blown up.</div>

<p>The sun was setting. The western horizon
was mantled by a canopy of gold. Von Spee's
man&#339;uvre in closing in nearer to the shore
had placed him in an advantageous position as
regards the light. The British ships, when the
sun had set, were sharply outlined against the
glowing sky. The Germans were partly hidden<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
in the failing light and by the mountainous
coast. The island of Santa Maria, off Coronel,
lay in the distance. Von Spee had been gradually
closing to within 12,000 yards. The appropriate
moment for engaging seemed to be
approaching. A few minutes after sunset,
about seven o'clock, the leading German cruiser
opened fire with her largest guns. Shells
shrieked over and short of the <i>Good Hope</i>,
some falling within five hundred yards. As
battle was now imminent, the <i>Otranto</i> began
to haul out of line, and to edge away to the
south-west. The squadrons were converging
rapidly, but the smaller cruisers were as yet
out of range. The British replied in quick
succession to the German fire. As the distance
lessened, each ship engaged that opposite in
the line. The <i>Good Hope</i> and the <i>Monmouth</i>
had to bear the brunt of the broadsides of the
<i>Scharnhorst</i> and the <i>Gneisenau</i>. The <i>Glasgow</i>,
in the rear, exchanged shots with the light
cruisers, the <i>Leipzig</i> and the <i>Dresden</i>. The
shooting was deadly. The third of the rapid
salvos of the enemy armoured cruisers set the
<i>Good Hope</i> and the <i>Monmouth</i> afire. Shells
began to find their mark, some exploding overhead
and bursting in all directions. In about
ten minutes the <i>Monmouth</i> sheered off the line
to westward about one hundred yards. She
was being hit heavily. Her foremost turret,
shielding one of her 6-inch guns, was in flames.
She seemed to be reeling and shaking. She
fell back into line, however, and then out again
to eastward, her 6-inch guns roaring intermittently.
Darkness was now gathering fast. The
range had narrowed to about 5,000 yards. The
seven ships were all in action. Many shells
striking the sea sent up columns of white spray,
showing weirdly in the twilight. It was an impressive
scene. The dim light, the heavy seas,
the rolling of the vessels, distracted the aim.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
Some of the guns upon the main decks, being
near the water-line, became with each roll almost
awash. The British could fire only at the
flashes of the enemy's guns. Often the heavy
head seas hid even the flashes from the gun-layers.
It was impossible to gauge the effect
of their shells. The fore-turret of the <i>Good
Hope</i> burst into flames, and she began to fall
away out of line towards the enemy. The
<i>Glasgow</i> kept up a continual fire upon the
German light cruisers with one of her 6-inch
guns and her port batteries. A shell struck
her below deck, and men waited for the planks
to rise. No explosion nor fire, however, occurred.
But the British flagship was now
burning brightly forward, and was falling more
and more out of line to eastward. It was about
a quarter to eight. Suddenly there was the
roar of an explosion. The part about the <i>Good
Hope's</i> after-funnel split asunder, and a column
of flame, sparks, and d&eacute;bris was blown up to a
height of about two hundred feet. She never
fired her guns again. Total destruction must
have followed. Sir Christopher Cradock and
nine hundred brave sailors went down in the
stormy deep. The other ships raced past her
in the darkness. The <i>Monmouth</i> was in great
distress. She left the line after a while, and
turned back, steaming with difficulty to northwest.
She had ceased firing. The vessels had
been travelling at a rate which varied from
seven to seventeen knots. The <i>Glasgow</i>, now
left alone, eased her speed in order to avoid
shells intended for the <i>Monmouth</i>. The Germans
dropped slowly back. The <i>Scharnhorst</i>
and the <i>Gneisenau</i> now concentrated their
salvos upon the <i>Glasgow</i>. The range was about
4,500 yards. A shell struck the second funnel:
five others hit her side at the waterline, but
fortunately not in dangerous places. Luce,
her captain, since the flagship was no more,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
was senior officer. He brought his vessel round
and moved rapidly back.</p>

<p>The <i>Monmouth</i> had now fallen away to a
north-easterly course. Luce stood by signalling.
Could she steer north-west? She was making
water badly forward, Captain Brandt answered,
and he wanted to get stern to sea. The enemy
were following, Luce signalled again. There
was no reply. The <i>Glasgow</i> steamed nearer.
The <i>Monmouth</i> was in a sinking condition.
Her bows were under water, and the men were
assembled at the stern. The sea was running
very high. Rain and mist had come on, though
a moon was now rising. The enemy had altered
course, and were approaching in line abreast
about 6,000 yards away. A light kept twinkling
at regular intervals from one of the ships.
They were signalling in Morse, and evidently
were forming plans of action. Firing was still
proceeding intermittently. It was about half-past
eight. Captain Luce could see nothing
for it but to abandon the <i>Monmouth</i> to her
fate. To rescue her crew, under such conditions,
was impossible, while to stand by and
endeavour to defend her would be folly. The
<i>Glasgow</i> was not armoured, and could not contend
with armoured vessels. Of the two guns
she possessed capable of piercing the enemy's
armour, one had been put out of action ten minutes
after the start. If she stayed and fought
to the end, 370 good lives, in addition to the
sufficiently heavy toll of 1,600 in the <i>Good Hope</i>
and the <i>Monmouth</i>, would be needlessly sacrificed.
The <i>Canopus</i>, moreover, must be warned.
She was coming up from the south to sure
destruction. She could hardly be expected successfully
to combat the whole German squadron.
Nevertheless, it must have been with
heavy hearts that the men of the <i>Glasgow</i>
turned away to seek safety in flight. It is
recorded that, as they moved off into the darkness,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
a cheer broke forth from the <i>Monmouth's</i>
decks. Before the sinking vessel became lost to
sight another and a third went up. At about
a quarter past nine the <i>N&uuml;rnberg</i>, which had
not been engaged in the main action, came
across the <i>Monmouth</i>. It is said that, though
in a sinking condition, the British ship attempted
to ram her enemy. But the <i>N&uuml;rnberg</i>
began to bombard her, and she capsized.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Glasgow</i>
and
<i>Canopus</i>
start for
Rio de
Janeiro.</div>

<p>The <i>Glasgow</i> steamed off in a north-westerly
direction. A few minutes before nine the
enemy became lost to sight. Half an hour later
many distant flashes of gunfire, the death-struggle
of the <i>Monmouth</i>, were seen. The play
of a searchlight, which lasted a few seconds
and then disappeared, was also observed. The
vessel bore round gradually to the south. Her
wireless was put into operation, and she made
efforts to get through to the <i>Canopus</i>. But the
Germans had again set their apparatus in
motion, and the messages were jambed. Only
after some hours was the <i>Glasgow</i> successful.
Steaming hard at twenty-four knots through
the heavy seas, her engines and boilers fortunately
being intact, she at length joined the
battleship. The two ships made straight for
the Falkland Islands.</p>

<p>The news of the disaster stirred great alarm
in the colony. Before the day on which the
ships arrived was out the dismay was further
increased. The <i>Canopus</i> at first expected to
stay ten days. Her presence provided substantial
relief. If the enemy appeared, she
and even the damaged <i>Glasgow</i> could give a
very good account of themselves. But during
the morning Captain Grant of the <i>Canopus</i> received
a wireless message from the Admiralty.
He was to proceed immediately to Rio de
Janeiro with the <i>Glasgow</i>. The Brazilian Government
had granted the latter permission to
enter the dry dock there to make urgent repairs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
But seven days only were allowed for
this purpose. In the evening the warships cast
off, and steamed away to northward.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The colony
almost defenseless.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Falklands
prepare
for attack.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Burying
the
Governor's
silver and
table linen.</div>

<p>Stanley was now in an unenviable situation.
A powerful German squadron, flushed with
victory, was probably making for the Islands.
The colony was almost defenceless. All the
opposition that the enemy would meet would
be from a few hundred volunteers. A wireless
message that came through emphasized the
imminence of the danger. Warnings and instructions
were outlined. If the enemy landed,
the volunteers were to fight. But retiring tactics
must be adopted. Care should be taken
to keep out of range of the enemy's big guns.
The Governor at once called a council of war.
There could be little doubt that a descent would
be made upon the colony. The position was
full of peril. But resistance must certainly
be offered. The few women, children, and old
men who still remained at Stanley must be
sent away immediately. Fortunately the time
of year was propitious. November is, indeed,
in the Falklands considered the only dry month.
The ground is then covered with a variety of
sweet-scented flowers. Further, all the stores
it was possible to remove must be taken into
the 'camp'. Quantities of provisions must be
hidden away at various points within reach of
the town. In order to add to the mobility of
the defending force, it would be well to bring
in another hundred horses from the 'camp'.
Every man should be mounted. These measures
were duly carried out. Every preparation was
made and every precaution taken. Everybody
began to pack up boxes of goods. Clothes,
stores, and valuables were all taken away to
safety. Books, papers, and money were removed
from the Government offices, and from
the headquarters of the Falkland Islands Company.
What was not sent away was buried.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
The official papers and code-books were buried
every night, and dug up and dried every morning.
The Governor's tableclothes gave rise to
much anxiety. It was thought, since they were
marked 'G. R.', they would be liable to insult
by the Germans. They were accordingly buried.
This conscientious loyalty, however, proved
costly. The Governor's silver, wrapped in
green baize, was, unfortunately, placed in the
same hole. The tablecloths became mixed up
with the baize. The damp got through, and
the linen was badly stained. There was a feeling
that the attack would come at dawn. People
sat up all night, and only went to bed when
morning was well advanced. All offices were
closed and business was suspended. This state
of tension lasted several days. At length, from
the look-out post above the town, a warship,
apparently a cruiser, was seen making straight
for the wireless station. When she got within
range she turned broadside on. Her decks
were cleared for action.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Canopus</i>
arrives.</div>

<p>There was a call to arms. Church and dockyard
bells pealed out the alarm. Non-combatants
streamed out of the town into the 'camp'.
The volunteers paraded, and lined up with their
horses. It would soon become a question
whether to resist a landing or to retire. In
any event the men were ready and provided
with emergency rations. But no firing sounded.
Signals were exchanged between the vessel and
the shore. It was a false alarm. The new-comer
was H. M. S. <i>Canopus</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A serious
outlook&mdash;decks
are

action.</div>

<p>She had proceeded, in accordance with her
orders, towards Rio de Janeiro with the <i>Glasgow</i>.
When two days' journey off her destination,
however, she received another message.
She was directed to return and to defend the
Falklands in case of attack. These instructions
were received with mingled feelings. To
fight alone a powerful squadron was by no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
means an attractive prospect. Duty, however,
was duty. The <i>Canopus</i> turned about, and retraced
her passage. She set her wireless in
operation, and tried to get through to Stanley.
But for some reason she was unable to do so.
It was concluded that the Germans had made
a raid and had destroyed the wireless station.
Probably they had occupied the town. The outlook
seemed serious. The <i>Canopus</i> had her instructions,
however, and there was no drawing
back. The decks were cleared for action. Ammunition
was served out. Guns were loaded
and trained. With every man at his post the
ship steamed at full speed into the harbour.
Great was the relief when it was found that
all was well.</p>

<div class="sidenote">German
raid anticipated.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Shackleton's
visit
to South
Georgia.</div>

<p>The inhabitants were not less relieved. The
presence of the battleship was felt to add materially
to the security of the town. The Germans
would probably hesitate before attacking
a ship of her size. If they sustained damage
involving loss of fighting efficiency, there
was no harbour they could turn to for repair,
except so far as their seaworthiness was affected.
Nevertheless, it was almost certain
that some raid upon the Islands would be attempted.
Guns were landed from the ship, and
measures were taken to make the defence as
effective as possible. Perhaps if the enemy
blockaded Stanley, the British would be able
to hold out until other warships, certain to be
sent to avenge the defeat, arrived. Relief could
hardly be expected for two or three weeks. The
Falklands formed a very distant corner of the
Empire. It was doubtful, indeed, whether even
the ubiquitous German spy had penetrated to
these remote and barren shores. It could, however,
be recalled that, in 1882, a German expedition
had landed on South Georgia, a dependent
island of the Falklands, eight hundred
miles to their south-east, to observe the transit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
of Venus. Upon that same island, indeed, another
and a quite unsuspicious expedition had
landed, early in that very month, November.
Sir Ernest Shackleton, the explorer, had left
Buenos Ayres on the morning of October 26,
on his way across the antarctic continent. His
little vessel of 230 tons, the <i>Endurance</i>, passed
through the war zone in safety, and reached
South Georgia on November 5. He remained
for about a month before leaving for the lonely
tracts for which his little party was bound.
The island was his last link with civilization.
Though sub-antarctic, it possessed features as
up-to-date as electric-light, universal even in
pigsties and henhouses. And the march of man,
it was observed, had introduced the familiar
animals of the farmyard, and even a monkey,
into a region whose valleys, destitute of tree
or shrub, lay clothed with perpetual snow.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, November passed into December
without any appearance of the Germans off the
Falklands. The tension became very much relieved.
Women and children were brought back
to Stanley, after being away a month or six
weeks. Messages emanating from the hostile
squadron, registered by the wireless station,
indicated that the enemy were still in the
vicinity. But the condition of the colony became
again almost normal. The relief and
security were complete when, at length, on
Monday, December 7, a powerful British squadron,
under Vice-Admiral Sir Doveton Sturdee,
arrived at Port Stanley. There were seven
warships, besides the <i>Canopus</i>. The <i>Invincible</i>
and the <i>Inflexible</i> had left Plymouth on November
11, and had proceeded to the West
Indies. Their mission was to avenge Coronel.
They had picked up at Albatross Rock the
<i>Carnarvon</i>, <i>Cornwall</i>, <i>Bristol</i>, <i>Kent</i>, <i>Glasgow</i>,
now repaired, and <i>Macedonia</i>, an armed liner.
All had then steamed southwards towards the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
Falklands. The vessels started coaling. Officers
came ashore to stretch their legs. Certain
stores were laid in. It was anticipated that
the squadron would depart in search of the
enemy on the evening of the following day.
That search might, indeed, be a matter of
months. Early next morning, December 8, at
about eight o'clock, a volunteer observer posted
on Sapper's Hill, two miles from Stanley,
sighted two vessels upon the horizon. Twenty
minutes later the smoke of two others came into
view in the same direction. They were soon
recognized as German cruisers. The excitement
was intense. The news was immediately
carried to the authorities. It was hastily signalled
to the fleet. Most of the ships were at
anchor in Port William, the outer entrance to
Port Stanley. Some of the naval officers were
aroused from their repose. It is recorded that,
upon hearing the news, the flag-lieutenant
dashed down to Admiral Sturdee's cabin, clad
in his pyjamas. Sir Doveton was shaving. The
lieutenant poured forth his information. 'Well,'
said the Admiral, dryly, 'you had better go and
get dressed. We'll see about it later.'<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1">[1]</a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor"></a></p>

<p>The Graf von Spee had, meanwhile, after the
Battle of Coronel, been devoting himself to
harrying maritime commerce. The Falklands
could wait for the present. Since the beginning
of hostilities the work of his light cruisers
had been moderately successful. The <i>N&uuml;rnberg</i>
had cut the cable between Bamfield, British
Columbia, and Fanning Island. The <i>Leipzig</i>
had accounted for at least four British merchantmen,
and the <i>Dresden</i> for at least two
more. The armed liner <i>Eitel Friedrich</i> had also<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
achieved some success. Several traders had
had narrow escapes. The Chilian coast was
in a state of blockade to British vessels, the
ports being crowded with shipping that hesitated
to venture forth into the danger zone.
The Germans were masters of the Pacific and
South Atlantic trade routes. The Straits of
Magellan and the Horn formed a great waterway
of commerce, which for sailing vessels
was, indeed, the only eastern outlet from the
Pacific. But completely as he had the situation
in hand, von Spee was experiencing increasing
problems and difficulties with regard
to supplies of coal and provisions. Without
these he was impotent. He had been employing
German merchantmen to great advantage for
refueling. But trouble was brewing with the
Chilian authorities. Many signs were leading
the latter to suspect that, contrary to international
law, German traders were loading at
Chilian ports cargoes of coal and provisions,
contraband of war, and were transferring them
at sea to the German warships. There were
other causes of complaint. Juan Fernandez,
the isle of romance and of mystery, the home of
the original of Robinson Crusoe, was said to
have been degraded into use as a base for apportioning
the booty, coals and victuals, among
the belligerent vessels. The island was a
Chilian possession. It was practically certain
that von Spee's squadron had stayed there beyond
the legal limit of time. A French merchantman
had, contrary to rule, also been sunk
there by the <i>Dresden</i>, within Chilian territorial
waters. Inquiries in other quarters were being
made, moreover, as to the friendly wireless
stations which the Germans had been utilizing
secretly in Colombia and Ecuador; while a
rumour was current in the United States that
neutral vessels had been seized and pillaged on
the high seas. Von Spee soon found that he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
was nearing the end even of his illegitimate resources.
He had tried the patience of the
Chilian authorities too far. About the middle
of November they suddenly prohibited, as a
provisional measure, the vessels of the Kosmos
Company from leaving any Chilian port. On
November 24 a Government ship was sent to
Juan Fernandez to investigate, and to see that
Chilian neutrality was upheld. Many such
signs seemed to warn von Spee that the time
was appropriate to a sudden disappearance.
He gathered his squadron for a descent at last
upon the Falklands. His plans must be, not
merely for a raid, but for an occupation. There
were probably two or three small ships there.
They should be sunk. The wireless station
must be destroyed. The Islands, after a landing
had been effected and the defence reduced,
could be used as a base for the German operations.
There were large quantities of coal and
stores at Stanley. The harbour possessed facilities
for refitting. To dislodge a strong German
naval force, with adequate guns, placed in occupation
of the colony, would be a difficult task
for the enemy. The Falklands had many possibilities.
According to von Spee's information
they were feebly defended and would fall an
easy prey. At length, early in the morning of
December 8, the Admiral brought his fleet off
Stanley. His five cruisers approached from the
south. They were, of course, observed. A
warning gun, probably from one of the small
ships which he would shortly sink, sounded the
alarm inside the harbour. There was no need,
however, for haste. At twenty minutes past
nine the <i>Gneisenau</i> and the <i>N&uuml;rnberg</i> moved
towards the wireless station, and brought their
guns to bear upon it. But suddenly from inside
the harbour there came the thunder of a
big gun. Five shells, of very heavy calibre,
screamed in quick succession from over the low-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>lying
land. One of the vessels was struck. Surprise
and bewilderment took the Germans.
This was most unexpected. The <i>Gneisenau</i>
and the <i>N&uuml;rnberg</i> hastily retired out of range.</p>

<p>Sir Doveton and his fleet, meanwhile, had
gone to breakfast. Steam for full speed was
got up as rapidly as possible. Coaling operations
had recommenced at 6.30 that morning.
The colliers were hurriedly cast off, and the
decks were cleared for action. Officers and
men were delighted at the prospect of an early
fight. The Germans had saved them a long cold
search around the Horn by calling for them.
There was going to be no mistake this time.
The enemy could not escape. Sturdee's squadron
was superior both in weight and speed to
the German. It consisted of two battle-cruisers
of over 17,000 tons, the <i>Invincible</i> and <i>Inflexible;</i>
of three cruisers of about 10,000 tons,
the <i>Carnarvon</i>, <i>Kent</i>, and <i>Cornwall;</i> and of two
light cruisers of 4,800 tons, the <i>Glasgow</i> and
<i>Bristol</i>. The primary armament of the <i>Invincible</i>
and <i>Inflexible</i> was eight 12-inch guns;
of the <i>Carnarvon</i>, four 7'5-inch; of the <i>Kent</i> and
<i>Cornwall</i>, fourteen 6-inch; of the <i>Glasgow</i> and
<i>Bristol</i>, two 6-inch. The speed of the battle-cruisers
was twenty-eight knots; of the three
middle-class cruisers, twenty-two to twenty-four
knots; and of the light cruisers, twenty-five
to twenty-six knots. In size, in armament,
in speed, the British squadron would decidedly
preponderate. Admiral Sturdee, however,
though confident of victory, was determined to
take no risks, and to minimize loss in men and
material by making full use of his superior
long-range gunfire, and of his superior speed.
He would wait, screened by the land, until the
Germans had drawn nearer. Everything should
be got ready carefully. Undue excitement was
to be deprecated. Meanwhile, he watched the
enemy closely. At about a quarter to nine,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
Captain Grant of the <i>Canopus</i> reported that
the first two ships sighted were now about eight
miles away: the other two were still at a distance
of some twenty miles. The <i>Kent</i> passed
down the harbour and took up a position at
the entrance. Five minutes later the smoke
of a fifth German vessel was observed. When,
in about half an hour's time, the two leading
enemy ships made a threatening move in the
direction of the wireless station, the Admiral
ordered a swift counterstroke. Officers upon
the hills above the town signalled the range,
11,000 yards, to the <i>Canopus</i>. She opened fire
with her 12-inch guns. The Germans hoisted
their colours and drew back. Their masts and
smoke were now visible from the upper bridge
of the <i>Invincible</i> across the low land bounding
Port William on the south. Within a few minutes
the two cruisers altered course and made
for the harbour-mouth. Here the <i>Kent</i> lay
stationed. It seemed that the Germans were
about to engage her. As, however, they approached,
the masts and funnels of two large
ships at anchor within the port became visible
to them. The <i>Gneisenau</i> and the <i>N&uuml;rnberg</i>
could hardly expect to contend alone with this
force. They at once changed their direction,
and moved back at increased speed to join their
consorts.</p>

<p>The morning was gloriously fine. The sun
shone brightly, the sky was clear, the sea was
calm, and a breeze blew lightly from the north-west.
It was one of the rare bright stretches
that visit the Islands, for usually rain falls,
mostly in misty drizzles, on about 250 days in
the year. At twenty minutes to ten the <i>Glasgow</i>
weighed anchor, and joined the <i>Kent</i> at
the harbour-mouth. Five minutes later the rest
of the squadron weighed, and began to steam
out. The battleship <i>Canopus</i>, her speed making
her unsuitable for a chase, was left in harbour.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
The <i>Bristol</i> and the <i>Macedonia</i> also remained
behind for the present. By a dexterous use of
oil fuel the two battle-cruisers were kept
shrouded as much as possible in dense clouds
of smoke. The enemy for some time could not
gauge their size. But as vessel after vessel
emerged, Admiral von Spee grew uneasy. The
English were in altogether unexpected strength.
His squadron could not cope with such force.
He had played into the enemy's hands, and
unless he could outspeed their ships, the game
was up. Without hesitation, he steamed off
at high speed to eastward. The British followed,
steaming at fifteen to eighteen knots.
The enemy, to their south-east, were easily
visible. At twenty past ten an order for a general
chase was signalled. The <i>Invincible</i> and
the <i>Inflexible</i> quickly drew to the fore. The
Germans were roughly in line abreast, 20,000
yards, or some eleven miles, ahead. The morning
sunlight, the gleaming seas, the grey
warships, white foam springing from their
bows, tearing at high speed through the waves,
formed a magnificent spectacle. Crowds of the
inhabitants of Stanley gathered upon the hills
above the town to view the chase. The excitement
and enthusiasm were intense. The vessels
were in sight about two hours. At about a
quarter past eleven it was reported from a point
in the south of East Falkland that three other
German ships were in sight. They were probably
colliers or transports. The <i>Bristol</i> signalled
the information to Admiral Sturdee. He
at once ordered her, with the armed liner
<i>Macedonia</i>, to hasten in their direction and
destroy them. The newcomers made off to
south-west, and the British followed. Meanwhile
the rest of the squadron, now travelling
at twenty-three knots, were slowly closing upon
the enemy. The distance had narrowed to 15-16,000
yards. The British were within striking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
range. Nevertheless, Sturdee decided to wait
till after dinner before engaging. His guns
could outdistance those of the enemy. It would
be advisable for him to keep at long range.
The Germans, on the other hand, would be
forced, when firing commenced, to alter course
and draw in, in order to bring their own guns
into play. The men had their midday meal at
twelve o'clock as usual. It is said that comfortable
time was allowed afterwards for a
smoke. The <i>Invincible</i>, <i>Inflexible</i>, and <i>Glasgow</i>
at about 12.30 increased their speed to between
twenty-five and twenty-eight knots, and went on
ahead. Just after a quarter to one there was
a signal from the Admiral: 'Open fire and engage
the enemy.' A few minutes later there
were sharp commands. The ranges were signalled,
and the bigger guns were laid. Fiery
glares and dense clouds of smoke burst suddenly
from their muzzles. The air quivered with their
thunder. Shells went screaming in the direction
of the nearest light cruiser, the <i>Leipzig</i>,
which was dropping rapidly astern. The firing
was uncomfortably accurate. The three smaller
German cruisers very soon left the line, and
made an attempt, veering off to the south, to
scatter and escape. Flame and smoke issued
from the <i>Leipzig</i>, before she drew clear, where
a shell had struck. Sir Doveton Sturdee directed
the <i>Glasgow</i>, <i>Kent</i>, and <i>Cornwall</i> to pursue
the German light cruisers. With his remaining
vessels, the <i>Invincible</i>, the <i>Inflexible</i>,
and the slower <i>Carnarvon</i>, he turned upon the
<i>Scharnhorst</i> and the <i>Gneisenau</i>, and began
operations in earnest.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The

<div class="sidenote">The

<p>The interval of sunlight which had opened
the day with such promise was of short duration.
The sky became overcast. Soon after
four o'clock the air was thick with rain-mist.
From 1.15 onwards for three hours a fierce
duel was maintained between the two British<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
battle-cruisers and the two German armoured
cruisers. The enemy made every effort to get
away. They replied to the British fire for some
time, having dropped back to within 13,500
yards. But shortly after two o'clock they
changed their course, and began to haul out
to south-east. The <i>Invincible</i> and the <i>Inflexible</i>
had eased their speed, and the range now
widened by about 3,000 yards. A second chase
ensued. A full-rigged sailing-ship appeared in
the distance at about a quarter to three. Her
crew <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'most'">must</ins> have beheld an awe-inspiring scene.
Shortly before the hour firing recommenced.
The action began to develop. Great coolness
and efficiency were shown on board the British
vessels. Every man was at his battle-station,
behind armour. Fire-control parties were at
their instruments. Water from numerous hoses
was flooding the decks as a precaution against
fire. The roaring of the discharges, the screaming
of the shells, the clangour of metal upon
metal, the crashes of the explosions, made up
a tumult that was painful in its intensity.
During intervals in the firing came the rushing
of the waves and of the breeze, and the grinding
and grunting of the hydraulic engines in the
turrets, where swung, training constantly upon
the enemy, the greater guns. The Germans
soon began to show signs of distress. The
<i>Scharnhorst</i> particularly suffered. Dense clouds
of smoke, making it difficult for the British accurately
to gauge the damage, rose from her
decks. Shells rending her side disclosed momentarily
the dull red glow of flame. She was
burning fiercely. The firing on both sides was
deadly, though the German had slackened considerably.
But the British vessels, through
their preponderance in gunfire, suffered little
damage. Their 12-inch guns hit their marks
constantly, while 8&middot;2-inch guns of the <i>Scharnhorst</i>
were accurate, but ineffective. She veered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
to starboard at about 3.30, to bring into play
her starboard batteries. Both her masts and
three of her four funnels were shot away. At
length the German flagship began to settle
down rapidly in the waters. It was about a
quarter past four. There was a swirl of the
seas and a rush of steam and smoke. The
<i>Scharnhorst</i> disappeared. She went down with
her flag flying to an ocean grave, bearing 760
brave men and a gallant admiral, whose name
will deservedly rank high in the annals of German
naval history. The <i>Gneisenau</i> passed on
the far side of her sunken flagship. With the
guns of both battle-cruisers now bearing upon
her alone, the German was soon in sore straits.
But she fought on gallantly for a considerable
time. At half-past five she had ceased firing,
and appeared to be sinking. She had suffered
severe damage. Smoke and steam were rising
everywhere. Her bridge had been shot away.
Her foremost funnel was resting against the
second. Her upper deck was so shattered that
it could not be crossed, and every man upon it
had been killed. An exploding shell had hurled
one of the gun-turrets bodily overboard. Fire
was raging aft. Her colours had been shot
away several times, and hoisted as often. One
of the flags was hauled down at about twenty
to six, though that at the peak was still flying.
She began to fire again with a single gun. The
<i>Invincible</i>, the <i>Inflexible</i>, and the <i>Carnarvon</i>,
which had now come up, closed in upon the
doomed vessel. Firing was recommenced. The
<i>Gneisenau</i> was not moving. Both her engines
were smashed. Shells striking the water near
her sent up colossal columns of water, which,
falling upon the ship, put out some of the fires.
She soon began to settle down in the waves.
All her guns were now out of action, and
Sturdee ordered the "Cease fire". There could
be little doubt that her stubborn resistance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
was nearing its end. The German commander
lined up his men on the decks. The ammunition
was exhausted. The ship would soon go
down. Some six hundred men had already
been killed. The survivors had better provide
themselves with articles for their support in
the water. At six o'clock the <i>Gneisenau</i> heeled
over suddenly. Clouds of steam sprang forth.
Her stem swung up into the air, and she sank.
Large numbers of her crew could be seen floating
in the icy waves, hanging on to pieces of
wreckage, and uttering terribly uncanny cries.
The sea was choppy. Drizzling rain was falling.
The British steamed up immediately. All
undamaged boats were got out. Ropes were
lowered. Lifebuoys and spars were thrown to
the drowning men. But many of them, numbed
by the freezing water, let go their hold and
sank. About 180, among them the captain of
the <i>Gneisenau</i>, were saved. It is said that
much agreeable surprise, upon the discovery
that their anticipations of being shot would not
be realized, was manifested by the German
sailors.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
<i>Eitel
Friedrich</i>
escapes.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The
<i>Leipzig</i>
is sunk.</div>

<p>Meanwhile, battle had been in progress elsewhere.
The <i>Bristol</i> and the <i>Macedonia</i> had
overtaken <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'the the'">the</ins> transports <i>Baden</i> and <i>Santa
Isabel</i>, had captured their crews, and had sunk
the ships. The armed liner accompanying
them, the <i>Eitel Friedrich</i>, had, however, made
off and got away by means of her superior
speed. The <i>Kent</i>, <i>Glasgow</i> and <i>Cornwall</i> had
pursued the German light cruisers in a southerly
direction. The <i>Dresden</i>, the fastest,
proved too speedy a vessel to overtake. She
was ahead of her consorts, upon either quarter,
and made her escape whilst they were being
engaged. The <i>Kent</i> gave chase to the <i>N&uuml;rnberg</i>.
The <i>Glasgow</i>, in pursuit of the <i>Leipzig</i>,
raced ahead of the <i>Cornwall</i>, and by about
three o'clock in the afternoon had closed sufficiently,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
within 12,000 yards, to open fire with
her foremost guns. The German ship turned
every now and then to fire a salvo. Soon a
regular battle began which was maintained for
some hours. Shells fell all around the <i>Glasgow</i>.
There were several narrow escapes, but the
casualties were few. Shortly after six a wireless
message was received from Admiral Sturdee,
announcing that the <i>Scharnhorst</i> and the
<i>Gneisenau</i> had been sunk. A cheer surged up,
and the men set to work with renewed spirits
and energy. The <i>Cornwall</i> had come up some
time before, and the <i>Leipzig</i> was now severely
damaged. But she fought on for three more
hours. Darkness came on. The German cruiser
began to burn fore and aft. It was nine o'clock
before she at last turned over and sank.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The <i>Kent</i>
returns.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Sinking
of the
<i>N&uuml;rnberg</i>.</div>

<p>The British vessels had, during the course
of the action, steamed miles apart, and far out
of sight of land. During the evening and night
they began to get into touch with one another
and with Stanley by means of their wireless.
All the ships except the <i>Kent</i> were accounted
for, and reported all well. But no reply was
forthcoming to the numerous calls, "Kent, Kent,
Kent", that were sent out. She had, in chase
of the <i>N&uuml;rnberg</i>, lost all touch with the rest of
the squadron. There was great uneasiness. It
was feared that she had been lost. The other
ships were directed to search for her, and for
the <i>N&uuml;rnberg</i> and the <i>Dresden</i>. Late in the
afternoon of the following day, however, she entered
Stanley harbour safely. Her wireless had
been destroyed, but she had sunk the <i>N&uuml;rnberg</i>,
after a very stern struggle. The German captain,
Sch&ouml;nberg, is reported, indeed, to have
said at Honolulu, "The <i>N&uuml;rnberg</i> will very likely
be our coffin. But we are ready to fight to
the last". He had fought and died true to his
words. The German ship was ordinarily more
than a knot faster than the British. But the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
engineers and stokers of the <i>Kent</i> rose magnificently
to the occasion. Fuel was piled high.
Her engines were strained to the utmost. Soon
she was speeding through the waves at twenty-five
knots, a knot and a half more than her
registered speed. The <i>N&uuml;rnberg</i> drew nearer.
At five o'clock she was within range, and firing
was opened. A sharp action began which lasted
some two and a half hours. The <i>Kent</i> was
struck many times, and lost several men. She
had one narrow escape. A bursting shell ignited
some cordite charges, and a flash of flame went
down the hoist into the ammunition passage.
Some empty shell bags began to burn. But a
sergeant picked up a cordite charge and hurled
it out of danger. Seizing a fire hose, he flooded
the compartment and extinguished the fire. A
disastrous explosion, which might have proved
fatal to the vessel, was thus averted. Her
silken ensign and jack, presented by the ladies
of Kent, were torn to ribbons. The gallant captain
collected the pieces, some being caught
in the rigging, and carefully preserved them.
The <i>N&uuml;rnberg</i>, however, was soon in sore
straits. Many shells struck her, and she was
set afire. Day drew into evening, and darkness
deepened. The Germans ceased firing, and the
<i>Kent</i>, within about 3,000 yards, followed suit
upon the enemy's colours being hauled down.
The <i>N&uuml;rnberg</i> sank just before half-past seven.
As she disappeared beneath the surface, men
upon her quarterdeck were waving the German
ensign. The <i>Kent</i>, after picking up some survivors,
put about, and returned to Stanley.</p>

<p>Here the rest of the squadron soon gathered.
Congratulatory telegrams began to pour in to
Sir Doveton Sturdee. And the curtain closed,
in the flush of triumph, upon the most memorable
and most dramatic episode in the history
of the Falklands.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The <i>Eitel

<div class="sidenote">The

sinks.</div>

<p>One further episode remains to complete the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
story. The <i>Dresden</i> and the armed liner <i>Eitel
Friedrich</i>, the sole survivors of the German
squadron, made once more for the Pacific. They
were lost sight of for many weeks. Suspicious
movements and activities on the part of German
merchantmen were, however, again observed.
The Government wireless station at
Valparaiso intercepted messages from the <i>Dresden</i>
summoning friendly vessels to bring her
supplies. Persistent rumours began to be circulated
that she was hiding in the inlets of
southern Chili. During January, 1915, the
<i>Eitel Friedrich</i> seized and destroyed six vessels,
chiefly sailing-ships, some in Pacific, most
in Atlantic waters. In February she accounted
for four more. Towards the end of the month
a British barque was sunk by the <i>Dresden</i>. The
position was again rapidly becoming troublesome.
The movement of British shipping, on
the Chilian coast had to be suspended. But the
<i>Glasgow</i> and the <i>Kent</i> were on the <i>Dresden's</i>
track. The <i>Kent</i> entered Coronel on March 13,
coaled, and departed the same night. The <i>Eitel
Friedrich</i>, meanwhile, had arrived at Newport
News, a United States port, with her engines
badly in need of repair. Much indignation was
aroused among Americans by the announcement
that one of her victims had been an American
vessel. The German liner had many prisoners
on board. Declarations of a resolve, if he had
been caught by the British, to have sunk fighting
to the last, were repeatedly and emphatically
declaimed by the German captain. Five
days later he learned that the <i>Dresden</i> had
tamely surrendered off Juan Fernandez after a
five minutes' action. The <i>Kent</i>, at nine o'clock
on the morning after she had left Coronel, together
with the <i>Glasgow</i> and the auxiliary
cruiser <i>Orama</i>, came up with the <i>Dresden</i> near
the island. A sharp encounter followed. The
German cruiser was hit heavily. Fire broke<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
out. In five minutes' time she hauled down her
colours and hoisted a white flag. The crew
were taken off. The <i>Dresden</i> continued to burn
for some time, until finally her magazine exploded
and she sank. The German officers contended
that their vessel was sunk within Chilian
territorial waters. It had not hitherto been
noticeable that their consciences were concerned
to maintain Chilian neutrality inviolate.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Results
of the
Falkland
battle.</div>

<p>The Battle of the Falkland Islands was the
first decisive naval contest of the war. It removed
a formidable menace to the trade routes.
It relieved British convoys and transports
from danger of interruption. It freed many
battleships and cruisers, engaged in sweeping
the oceans, for other usefulness. It gave Great
Britain effective mastery of the outer seas.
Henceforth German naval ambition, frustrated
in its endeavour to disorganize the trade
routes, was forced, within the limits of the
North Sea and of British waters, to seek less
adventurous but more disreputable ends. A
series of bombardments of coast towns was
planned. A preliminary success was followed
by a galling disaster.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>With the exception of the naval engagements
described above, the operations of the Germans
in the sea was limited chiefly to preying
upon enemy commerce by isolated vessels. Of
these terrors of the sea the most famous was
the cruiser <i>Emden</i>, which began her career on
October 29 by sinking the Russian cruiser
<i>Jemtchug</i> in Penang Harbor. Her career until
her destruction and the adventures of those of
her crew who escaped are described in the following
chapter.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>
<h2>CRUISE OF THE EMDEN</h2>

<h3>CAPTAIN M&Uuml;CKE</h3>


<div class="sidenote">The <i>Indus</i>
sunk.</div>

<p>"We on the <i>Emden</i> had no idea where
we were going, as on August 11,
1914, we separated from the cruiser
squadron, escorted only by the coaler <i>Markomannia</i>.
Under way, the <i>Emden</i> picked up
three officers from German steamers. That
was a piece of luck, for afterward we needed
many officers for the capturing and sinking of
steamers, or manning them when we took them
with us. On September 10 the first boat came
in sight. We stop her. She proves to be a
Greek tramp, chartered from England. On the
next day we met the <i>Indus</i>, bound for Bombay,
all fitted up as a troop transport, but still without
troops. That was the first one we sunk.
The crew we took aboard the <i>Markomannia</i>.
'What's the name of your ship?' the officers
asked us. '<i>Emden!</i> Impossible. Why, the
<i>Emden</i> was sunk long ago in battle with the
<i>Ascold!</i>'</p>

<div class="sidenote">Capturing
ships a
habit.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Provisions
secured.</div>

<p>"Then we sank the <i>Lovat</i> a troop transport
ship, and took the <i>Kabinga</i> along with us. One
gets used quickly to new forms of activity.
After a few days capturing ships became a
habit. Of the twenty-three which we captured,
most of them stopped after our first signal.
When they didn't, we fired a blank shot. Then
they all stopped. Only one, the <i>Clan Mattesen</i>,
waited for a real shot across the bow before
giving up its many automobiles and locomotives
to the seas. The officers were mostly very
polite and let down rope ladders for us. After
a few hours they'd be on board with us. We<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
ourselves never set foot in their cabins, nor
took charge of them. The officers often acted
on their own initiative and signaled to us the
nature of their cargo; then the Commandant
decided as to whether to sink the ship or take it
with us. Of the cargo, we always took everything
we could use, particularly provisions.
Many of the English officers and sailors made
good use of the hours of transfer to drink up
the supply of whisky instead of sacrificing it to
the waves. I heard that one Captain was lying
in tears at the enforced separation from his
beloved ship, but on investigation found that he
was merely dead drunk. But much worse was
the open betrayal which many practiced toward
their brother Captains, whom they probably
regarded as rivals. 'Haven't you met the
<i>Kilo</i> yet? If you keep on your course two
hours longer, you must overhaul her,' one Captain
said to me of his own accord. To other
tips from other Captains we owed many of our
prizes. I am prepared to give their names,"
Captain M&uuml;cke added.</p>

<p>"The Captain of one ship once called out
cheerily: 'Thank God I've been captured!' He
had received expense money for the trip to Australia,
and was now saved half the journey!</p>

<div class="sidenote">The process
of
sinking.</div>

<p>"We had mostly quiet weather, so that communication
with captured ships was easy. They
were mostly dynamited, or else shot close to
the water line. The sinking process took longer
or shorter, according to where they were struck
and the nature of the cargo. Mostly the ships
keeled over on their sides till the water flowed
down the smokestacks, a last puff of smoke
came out, and then they were gone. Many,
however, went down sharply bow first, the stern
rising high in the air.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
<i>Kabinga</i>.</div>

<p>"On the <i>Kabinga</i> the Captain had his wife
and youngster with him. He was inclined at
first to be disagreeable. 'What are you going<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
to do with us? Shall we be set out in boats
and left to our fate?' he asked. Afterward he
grew confidential, like all the Captains, called
us 'Old Chap,' gave the Lieutenant a nice new
oilskin, and as we finally let the <i>Kabinga</i> go
wrote us a letter of thanks, and his wife asked
for an Emden armband and a button. They
all gave us three cheers as they steamed away.
'Come to Calcutta some time!' was the last
thing the Captain said, 'and catch the pilots
so that those [unprintable seaman's epithet]
fellows will feel something of the war, too.'</p>

<p>"A few days later, by Calcutta, we made one
of our richest hauls, the <i>Diplomat</i>, chock full
of tea&mdash;we sunk $2,500,000 worth. On the same
day the <i>Trabbotch</i>, too, which steered right
straight toward us, literally into our arms.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Madras
oil tanks
burned.</div>

<p>"But now we wanted to beat it out of the
Bay of Bengal, because we had learned from
the papers that the <i>Emden</i> was being keenly
searched for. By Rangoon we encountered a
Norwegian tramp, which, for a cash consideration,
took over all the rest of our prisoners of
war. Later on another neutral ship rejected
a similar request and betrayed us to the Japanese
into the bargain. On September 23 we
reached Madras and steered straight for the
harbor. We stopped still 3,000 yards before
the city. Then we shot up the oil tanks. Three
or four burned up and illuminated the city.
They answered. Several of the papers asserted
that we left with lights out. On the contrary,
we showed our lights so as to seem to indicate
that we were going northward; only later did
we put them out, turn around, and steer southward.
As we left we could see the fire burning
brightly in the night, and even by daylight,
ninety sea miles away, we could still see the
smoke from the burning oil tanks. Two days
later we navigated around Ceylon, and could
see the lights of Colombo. On the same evening<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
we gathered in two more steamers, the
<i>King Lund</i> and <i>Tyweric</i>. The latter was particularly
good to us, for it brought us the very
latest evening papers from Colombo, which it
had only left two hours before.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ships
that the
<i>Emden</i>
captured.</div>

<p>"Everything went well, the only trouble was
that our prize, the <i>Markomannia</i>, didn't have
much coal left. We said one evening in the
mess: 'The only thing lacking now is a nice
steamer with 500 tons of nice Cardiff coal.' The
next evening we got her, the <i>Burresk</i>, brand-new,
from England on her maiden voyage,
bound for Hongkong. Then followed in order
the <i>Riberia</i>, <i>Foyle</i>, <i>Grand Ponrabbel</i>, <i>Benmore</i>,
<i>Troiens</i>, <i>Exfort</i>, <i>Grycefale</i>, <i>Sankt Eckbert</i>, <i>Chilkana</i>.
Most of them were sunk; the coal ships
were kept. The <i>Eckbert</i> was let go with a load
of passengers and captured crews. We also sent
the <i>Markomannia</i> away because it hadn't any
more coal. She was later captured by the English
together with all the prize papers about
their own captured ships. All this happened
before October 20; then we sailed southward,
to Deogazia, southwest of Colombo. South of
Lakadiven on Deogazia some Englishmen came
on board, solitary farmers who were in touch
with the world only every three months
through schooners. They knew nothing about
the war, took us for an English man-of-war,
and asked us to repair their motor boat for
them. We kept still and invited them to dinner
in our officers' mess. Presently they stood
still in front of the portrait of the Kaiser,
quite astounded. 'This is a German ship!' We
continued to keep still. 'Why is your ship so
dirty?' they asked. We shrugged our shoulders.
'Will you take some letters for us?' they
asked. 'Sorry, impossible; we don't know what
port we'll run into.' Then they left our ship,
but about the war we told them not a single
word.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Coal
steamers
captured.</div>

<p>"Now we went toward Miniko, where we sank
two ships more. The Captain of one of them
said to us: 'Why don't you try your luck
around north of Miniko? There's lots of ships
there now?' On the next day we found three
steamers to the north, one of them with much
desired Cardiff coal. From English papers on
captured ships we learned that we were being
hotly pursued. The stokers also told us a lot.
Our pursuers evidently must also have a convenient
base. Penang was the tip given us.
There we had hopes of finding two French
cruisers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
fourth
smokestack.</div>

<p>"One night we started for Penang. On October
28 we raised our very practicable fourth
smokestack&mdash;M&uuml;cke's own invention. As a result,
we were taken for English or French. The
harbor of Penang lies in a channel difficult of
access. There was nothing doing by night; we
had to do it at daybreak. At high speed, without
smoke, with lights out, we steered into the
mouth of the channel. A torpedo boat on
guard slept well. We steamed past its small
light. Inside lay a dark silhouette; that must
be a warship! But it wasn't the French cruiser
we were looking for. We recognized the silhouette&mdash;dead
sure; that was the Russian
cruiser <i>Jemtchug</i>. There it lay, there it slept
like a rat. No watch to be seen. They made
it easy for us. Because of the narrowness of
the harbor we had to keep close; we fired the
first torpedo at 400 yards. Then to be sure
things livened up a bit on the sleeping warship.
At the same time we took the crew quarters
under fire, five shells at a time. There was
a flash of flame on board, then a kind of burning
aureole. After the fourth shell, the flame
burned high. The first torpedo had struck the
ship too deep because we were too close to it,
a second torpedo which we fired off from the
other side didn't make the same mistake. After<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
twenty seconds there was absolutely not a trace
of the ship to be seen. The enemy had fired off
only about six shots.</p>

<div class="sidenote">French

<i>Emden</i>.</div>

<div class="sidenote">A burial
at sea.</div>

<p>"But now another ship, which we couldn't
see, was firing. That was the French <i>D'Ibreville</i>,
toward which we now turned at once. A
few minutes later an incoming torpedo destroyer
was reported. He mustn't find us in
that narrow harbor, otherwise we were finished!
But it proved to be a false alarm; only
a small merchant steamer that looked like a
destroyer, and which at once showed the merchant
flag and steered for shore. Shortly afterward
a second one was reported. This time
it proved to be the French torpedo boat <i>Mousquet</i>.
It comes straight toward us. That's always
remained a mystery to me, for it must
have heard the shooting. An officer whom we
fished up afterward explained to me that they
had only recognized we were a German warship
when they were quite close to us. The Frenchman
behaved well, accepted battle and fought
on, but was polished off by us with three broadsides.
The whole fight with both ships lasted
half an hour. The commander of the torpedo
boat lost both legs by the first broadside. When
he saw that part of his crew were leaping overboard,
he cried out: 'Tie me fast; I will not
survive after seeing Frenchmen desert their
ship!' As a matter of fact, he went down with
his ship as a brave Captain, lashed fast to
the mast. Then we fished up thirty heavily
wounded; three died at once. We sewed a Tri-color
(the French flag), wound them in it and
buried them at sea, with seamen's honors, three
salvos. That was my only sea fight. The second
one I did not take part in."</p>

<p>M&uuml;cke, who had been recounting his lively
narrative, partly like an officer, partly like an
artist, and not trying to eliminate the flavor
of adventure, now takes on quite another<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
tone as he comes to tell of the end of the
<i>Emden:</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">Landing
on Cocos
Island.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Order to
weigh
anchor.</div>

<p>"On November 9 I left the <i>Emden</i> in order to
destroy the wireless plant on the Cocos Island.
I had fifty men, four machine guns, about
thirty rifles. Just as we were about to destroy
the apparatus it reported: 'Careful; <i>Emden</i>
near.' The work of destruction went smoothly.
The wireless operator said: 'Thank God! it's
been like being under arrest day and night
lately.' Presently the <i>Emden</i> signaled to us:
'Hurry up.' I pack up, but simultaneously
wails the <i>Emden's</i> siren. I hurry up to the
bridge, see the flag 'Anna' go up. That means
'Weigh anchor.' We ran like mad into our
boat, but already the <i>Emden's</i> pennant goes up,
the battle flag is raised, they fire from starboard.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
<i>Sydney</i>
traps the
<i>Emden</i>.</div>

<p>"The enemy is concealed by the island and
therefore not to be seen, but I see the shells
strike the water. To follow and catch the
<i>Emden</i> is out of the question; she's going
twenty knots, I only four with my steam pinnace.
Therefore, I turn back to land, raise the
flag, declare German laws of war in force, seize
all arms, set up my machine guns on shore in
order to guard against a hostile landing. Then
I run again in order to observe the fight. From
the splash of the shells it looked as if the enemy
had fifteen-centimeter guns, bigger, therefore,
than the <i>Emden's</i>. He fired rapidly, but poorly.
It was the Australian cruiser <i>Sydney</i>."</p>

<p>"Have you heard?" M&uuml;cke suddenly asked
in between, "if anything has happened to the
<i>Sydney?</i> At the Dardanelles maybe?" And
his hatred of the <i>Emden's</i> "hangman" is visible
for a second in his blue eyes. Then he continues:</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
<i>Emden</i>
on fire.</div>

<p>"According to the accounts of the Englishmen
who saw the first part of the engagement
from shore, the <i>Emden</i> was cut off rapidly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
Her forward smokestack lay across the ship.
She went over to circular fighting and to torpedo
firing, but already burned fiercely aft.
Behind the mainmast several shells struck
home; we saw the high flame. Whether circular
fighting or a running fight now followed,
I don't know, because I again had to look to
my land defenses. Later I looked on from the
roof of a house. Now the <i>Emden</i> again stood
out to sea about 4,000 to 5,000 yards, still burning.
As she again turned toward the enemy,
the forward mast was shot away. On the
enemy no outward damage was apparent, but
columns of smoke showed where shots had
struck home. Then the <i>Emden</i> took a northerly
course, likewise the enemy, and I had to
stand there helpless gritting my teeth and
thinking: 'Damn it; the <i>Emden</i> is burning and
you aren't on board!' An Englishman who had
also climbed up to the roof of the house, approached
me, greeted me politely, and asked:
'Captain, would you like to have a game of
tennis with us?'</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
fighting
ships
disappear.</div>

<p>"The ships, still fighting, disappeared beyond
the horizon. I thought that an unlucky outcome
for the <i>Emden</i> was possible, also a landing
by the enemy on Keeling Island, at least
for the purpose of landing the wounded and
taking on provisions. As, according to the
statements of the Englishmen, there were other
ships in the neighborhood, I saw myself faced
with the certainty of having soon to surrender
because of a lack of ammunition. But for no
price did I and my men want to get into English
imprisonment. As I was thinking about
all this, the masts again appear on the horizon,
the <i>Emden</i> steaming easterly, but very much
slower. All at once the enemy, at high speed,
shoots by, apparently, quite close to the <i>Emden</i>.
A high, white waterspout showed among the
black smoke of the enemy. That was a torpedo.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
I see how the two opponents withdrew, the distance
growing greater between them; how they
separate, till they disappear in the darkness.
The fight had lasted ten hours.</p>

<div class="sidenote">M&uuml;cke
seizes a
schooner.</div>

<p>"I had made up my mind to leave the island
as quick as possible. The <i>Emden</i> was gone;
the danger for us growing. In the harbor I had
noticed a three-master, the schooner <i>Ayesha</i>.
Mr. Ross, the owner of the ship and of the
island, had warned me that the boat was leaky,
but I found it quite a seaworthy tub. Now
quickly provisions were taken on board for
eight weeks, water for four. The Englishmen
very kindly showed us the best water and gave
us clothing and utensils. They declared this
was their thanks for our 'moderation' and 'generosity.'
Then they collected the autographs
of our men, photographed them, and gave three
cheers as our last boat put off. It was evening,
nearly dark. We sailed away. After a
short address, amid three hurrahs, I raised the
German war flag on 'S.M.S. <i>Ayesha</i>.'"</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
<i>Ayesha</i>
sails westward.</div>

<p>"The <i>Ayesha</i> proved to be a really splendid
ship," M&uuml;cke continued, and whenever he happens
to speak of this sailing ship he grows
warmer. One notices the passion for sailing
which this seaman has, for he was trained on
a sailing ship and had won many prizes in
the regattas at Kiel. "But we had hardly any
instruments," he narrated, "we had only one
sextant and two chronometers on board, but
a chronometer journal was lacking. Luckily
I found an old 'Indian Ocean Directory' of
1882 on board; its information went back to
the year 1780.</p>

<div class="sidenote">En route
to Padang.</div>

<p>"At first we had to overhaul all the tackle,
for I didn't trust to peace, and we had left
the English Captain back on the island. I
had said: 'We are going to East Africa.'
Therefore I sailed at first westward, then
northward. There followed the monsoons, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
then also long periods of dead calm. Then
we scolded! Only two neutral ports came
seriously under consideration: Batavia and
Padang. At Keeling I cautiously asked about
Tsing-tao, of which I had naturally thought
first, and so quite by chance learned that it
had fallen. Now I decided for Padang, because
I knew I would be more apt to meet the
<i>Emden</i> there, also because there was a German
Consul there, because my schooner was unknown
there, and because I hoped to find German
ships there and learn some news. 'It'll
take you six to eight days to reach Batavia,'
a Captain had told me at Keeling. Now we
needed eighteen days to reach Padang, the
weather was so rottenly still.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Life on
board the
<i>Ayesha</i>.</div>

<p>"We had an excellent cook on board; he
had deserted from the French Foreign Legion.
But with water we had to go sparingly, each
man received three glasses daily. When it
rained, all possible receptacles were placed on
deck and the main sail was spread over the
cabin roof to catch the rain. The whole crew
went about naked, in order to spare our wash,
for the clothing from Keeling was soon in rags.
Toothbrushes were long ago out of sight. One
razor made the rounds of the crew. The entire
ship had one precious comb.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Dutch
torpedo
boat.</div>

<p>"As at length we came in the neighborhood
of Padang, on November 26, a ship appeared
for the first time and looked after our name.
But the name had been painted over, because
it was the former English name. As I think,
'You're rid of the fellow,' the ship comes again
in the evening, comes within a hundred yards
of us. I send all men below deck. I promenade
the deck as the solitary skipper. Through
Morse signals the stranger betrayed its identity.
It was the Hollandish torpedo boat <i>Lyn</i>.
I asked by signals, first in English, then twice
in German: 'Why do you follow me?' No<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
answer. The next morning I find myself in
Hollandish waters, so I raise pennant and war
flag. Now the <i>Lyn</i> came at top speed past us.
As it passes, I have my men line up on deck,
and give a greeting. The greeting is answered.
Then, before the harbor at Padang, I went
aboard the <i>Lyn</i> in my well and carefully preserved
uniform and declared my intentions.
The commandant opined that I could run into
the harbor, but whether I might come out
again was doubtful."</p>

<div class="sidenote">A German
ship.</div>

<p>"On the South Coast," interjected Lieutenant
Wellman, who at that time lay with a German
ship before Padang and only later joined
the landing corps of the <i>Emden</i>, "we suddenly
saw a three-master arrive. Great excitement
aboard our German ship, for the schooner carried
the German war flag. We thought she
came from New Guinea and at once made all
boats clear, on the <i>Kleist</i>, <i>Rheinland</i>, and
<i>Choising</i>, for we were all on the search for the
<i>Emden</i>. When we heard that the schooner
carried the landing corps, not a man of us
would believe it."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Supplies
are
refused.</div>

<p>"They wanted to treat me as a prize!" M&uuml;cke
now continued. "I said, 'I am a man of war,'
and pointed to my four machine guns. The
harbor authorities demanded a certification
for pennant and war flag, also papers to prove
that I was the commander of this warship.
I answered, for that I was only responsible
to my superior officers. Now they advised me
the most insistently to allow ourselves to be
interned peacefully. They said it wasn't at
all pleasant in the neighborhood. We'd fall
into the hands of the Japanese or the English.
As a matter of fact, we had again had great
luck. On the day before a Japanese warship
had cruised around here. Naturally, I rejected
all the well-meant and kindly advice, and
did this in presence of my lieutenants. I demanded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
provisions, water, sails, tackle, and
clothing. They replied we could take on board
everything which we formerly had on board,
but nothing which would mean an increase in
our naval strength. First thing, I wanted to
improve our wardrobe, for I had only one sock,
a pair of shoes, and one clean shirt, which had
become rather seedy. My comrades had even
less. But the Master of the Port declined to
let us have not only charts, but also clothing
and toothbrushes, on the ground that these
would be an increase of armament. Nobody
could come aboard, nobody could leave the
ship without permission. I requested that the
Consul be allowed to come aboard. This Consul,
Herr Schild, as also the Brothers B&auml;umer,
gave us assistance in the friendliest fashion.
From the German steamers boats could come
alongside and talk with us. Finally we were
allowed to have German papers. They were,
to be sure, from August. Until March we saw
no more papers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The German
ship
<i>Choising</i>.</div>

<p>"Hardly had we been towed out again after
twenty-four hours, on the evening of the 28th,
when a searchlight appeared before us. I
think: 'Better interned than prisoner.' I put
out all lights and withdrew to the shelter of
the island. But they were Hollanders and
didn't do anything to us. Then for two weeks
more we drifted around, lying still for days.
The weather was alternately still, rainy and
blowy. At length a ship comes in sight&mdash;a
freighter. It sees us and makes a big curve
around us. I make everything hastily 'clear
for battle.' Then one of our officers recognizes
her for the <i>Choising</i>. She shows the German
flag. I send up light rockets, although it was
broad day, and go with all sails set that were
still setable, toward her. The <i>Choising</i> is a
coaster, from Hongkong for Siam. It was at
Singapore when the war broke out, then went<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
to Batavia, was chartered loaded with coal for
the <i>Emden</i>, and had put into Padang in need,
because the coal in the hold had caught fire.
There we had met her.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The crew
board the
<i>Choising</i>.</div>

<p>"Great was our joy now. I had all my men
come on deck and line up for review. The
fellows hadn't a rag on. Thus, in Nature's
garb, we gave three cheers for the German flag
on the <i>Choising</i>. The men on the <i>Choising</i> told
us afterward 'we couldn't make out what that
meant, those stark naked fellows all cheering!'
The sea was too high, and we had to wait two
days before we could board the <i>Choising</i> on
December 16. We took very little with us;
the schooner was taken in tow. In the afternoon
we sunk the <i>Ayesha</i> and we were all very
sad. The good old <i>Ayesha</i> had served us faithfully
for six weeks. The log showed that we
had made 1,709 sea miles under sail since leaving
Keeling. She wasn't at all rotten and
unseaworthy, as they had told me, but nice and
white and dry inside. I had grown fond of
the ship, on which I could practice my old
sailing manoeuvres. The only trouble was that
the sails would go to pieces every now and
then because they were so old.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
<i>Ayesha</i>
is sunk.</div>

<p>"But anyway she went down quite properly,
didn't she?" M&uuml;cke turned to the officer. "We
had bored a hole in her; she filled slowly and
then all of a sudden plump disappeared! That
was the saddest day of the whole month. We
gave her three cheers, and my next yacht at
Kiel will be named <i>Ayesha</i>, that's sure.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Turkey
an ally of
Germany.</div>

<p>"To the Captain of the <i>Choising</i> I had said,
when I hailed him: 'I do not know what will
happen to the ship. The war situation may
make it necessary for me to strand it.' He did
not want to undertake the responsibility. I
proposed that we work together, and I would
take the responsibility. Then we traveled together
for three weeks, from Padang to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
Hodeida. The <i>Choising</i> was some ninety
meters long and had a speed of nine miles,
though sometimes only four. If she had not
accidentally arrived I had intended to cruise
high along the west coast of Sumatra to the
region of the northern monsoon. I came about
six degrees north, then over Aden to the
Arabian coast. In the Red Sea the northeastern
monsoon, which here blows southeast, could
bring us to Djidda. I had heard in Padang
that Turkey is allied with us, so we would be
able to get safely through Arabia to Germany.</p>

<p>"I next waited for information through
ships, but the <i>Choising</i> did not know anything
definite, either. By way of the <i>Luchs</i>, the
<i>K&ouml;nigsberg</i>, and <i>Kormoran</i> the reports were uncertain.
Besides, according to newspapers at
Aden, the Arabs were said to have fought with
the English. Therein there seemed to be offered
an opportunity near at hand to damage
the enemy. I therefore sailed with the <i>Choising</i>
in the direction of Aden. Lieutenant Gerdts
of the <i>Choising</i> had heard that the Arabian
railway now already went almost to Hodeida,
near the Perim Strait. The ship's surgeon
there, Docounlang, found confirmation of this
in Meyer's traveling handbook. This railway
could not have been taken over by the Englishmen,
who always dreamed of it. By doing this
they would have further and completely
wrought up the Mohammedans by making more
difficult the journey to Mecca. Best of all, we
thought, we'll simply step into the express train
and whizz nicely away to the North Sea. Certainly
there would be safe journeying homeward
through Arabia. To be sure, we hadn't
maps of the Red Sea; but it was the shortest
way to the foe, whether in Aden or in Germany.</p>

<div class="sidenote">On toward
Aden.</div>

<p>"Therefore, courage! Adenwards!"</p>

<div class="sidenote">Through
the Strait
of Perim.</div>

<p>"On the 7th of January, between 9 and 10
o'clock in the evening, we sneaked through the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
Strait of Perim. That lay swarming full of
Englishmen. We steered along the African
coast, close past an English cable layer. That
is my prettiest delight&mdash;how the Englishmen
will be vexed when they learn that we have
passed smoothly by Perim. On the next evening
we saw on the coast a few lights upon the
water. We thought that must be the pier of
Hodeida. But when we measured the distance
by night, 3,000 meters, I began to think that
must be something else. At dawn I made out
two masts and four smokestacks; that was an
enemy ship, and, what is more, an armored
French cruiser. I therefore ordered the <i>Choising</i>
to put to sea, and to return at night.</p>

<div class="sidenote">M&uuml;cke's
party
enters
Hodeida.</div>

<p>"The next day and night the same; then we
put out four boats&mdash;these we pulled to shore
at sunrise under the eyes of the unsuspecting
Frenchmen. The sea reeds were thick. A few
Arabs came close to us; then there ensued a
difficult negotiation with the Arabian Coast
Guards. For we did not even know whether
Hodeida was in English or French hands. We
waved to them, laid aside our arms, and made
signs to them. The Arabs, gathering together,
begin to rub two fingers together; that means
'We are friends.' We thought that meant 'We
are going to rub against you and are hostile.'
I therefore said: 'Boom-boom!' and pointed to
the warship. At all events, I set up my machine
guns and made preparations for a skirmish.
But, thank God! one of the Arabs understood
the word 'Germans'; that was good.</p>

<p>"Soon a hundred Arabs came and helped us,
and as we marched into Hodeida the Turkish
soldiers, who had been called out against us,
saluted us as allies and friends. To be sure,
there was not a trace of a railway, but we were
received very well, and they assured us we
could get through by land. Therefore, I gave
red-star signals at night, telling the <i>Choising</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
to sail away, since the enemy was near by. Inquiries
and determination concerning a safe
journey by land proceeded. I also heard that
in the interior, about six days' journey away,
there was healthy highland where our fever
invalids could recuperate. I therefore determined
to journey next to Sana. On the
Kaiser's birthday we held a great parade in
common with the Turkish troops&mdash;all this under
the noses of the Frenchmen. On the same
day we marched away from Hodeida to the
highland.</p>

<p>"Two months after our arrival at Hodeida
we again put to sea. The time spent in the
highlands of Sana passed in lengthy inquiries
and discussions that finally resulted in our
foregoing the journey by land through Arabia,
for religious reasons. But the time was not
altogether lost. The men who were sick with
malaria had, for the most part, recuperated
in the highland air.</p>

<div class="sidenote">To sea in
sambuks.</div>

<p>"The Turkish Government placed at our disposal
two 'sambuks' (sailing ships) of about
twenty-five tons, fifteen meters long and four
meters wide. But in fear of English spies, we
sailed from Jebaua, ten miles north of Hodeida.
That was on March 14. At first we sailed at a
considerable distance apart, so that we would
not both go to pot if an English gunboat caught
us. Therefore, we always had to sail in coastal
water. That is full of coral reefs, however."</p>

<div class="sidenote">One
sambuk
runs on a
reef.</div>

<p>"The Commander," Lieutenant Gerdts said,
"had charge of the first sambuk; I of the
second, which was the larger of the two, for
we had four sick men aboard. At first everything
went nicely for three days. For the most
part I could see the sails of the first <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'ships'">ship</ins>
ahead of me. On the third day I received orders
to draw nearer and to remain in the
vicinity of the first boat, because its pilot was
sailing less skillfully than mine. Suddenly, in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
the twilight, I felt a shock, then another, and
still another. The water poured in rapidly. I
had run upon the reef of a small island, where
the smaller sambuk was able barely to pass
because it had a foot less draught than mine.
Soon my ship was quite full, listed over, and all
of us&mdash;twenty-eight men&mdash;had to sit on the
uptilted edge of the boat. The little island
lies at Jesirat Marka, 200 miles north of
Jebaua. To be sure, an Arab boat lay near by,
but they did not know us. Nobody could help
us. If the Commander had not changed the
order a few hours before and asked us to sail
up closer, we would probably have drowned on
this coral reef&mdash;certainly would have died of
thirst. Moreover, the waters thereabouts are
full of sharks, and the evening was so squally
that our stranded boat was raised and banged
with every wave. We could scarcely move, and
the other boat was nowhere in sight. And now
it grew dark. At this stage I began to build a
raft of spars and old pieces of wood, that might
at all events keep us afloat.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The crew
finally
rescued.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Machine
guns
brought
up.</div>

<p>"But soon the first boat came into sight
again. The commander turned about and sent
over his little canoe; in this and in our own
canoe, in which two men could sit at each trip,
we first transferred the sick. Now the Arabs
began to help us. But just then the tropical
helmet of our doctor suddenly appeared above
the water in which he was standing up to his
ears. Thereupon the Arabs withdrew; we were
Christians, and they did not know that we were
friends. Now the other sambuk was so near
that we could have swam to it in half an hour,
but the seas were too high. At each trip a
good swimmer trailed along, hanging to the
painter of the canoe. When it became altogether
dark we could not see the boat any
more, for over there they were prevented by
the wind from keeping any light burning. My<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
men asked 'In what direction shall we swim?'
I answered: 'Swim in the direction of this or
that star; that must be about the direction of
the boat.' Finally a torch flared up over there&mdash;one
of the torches that were still left from
the <i>Emden</i>. But we had suffered considerably
through submersion. One sailor cried out:
'Oh, pshaw! it's all up with us now; that's a
searchlight.' The man who held out best was
Lieutenant Schmidt, who later lost his life.
About 10 o'clock we were all safe aboard, but
one of our typhus patients, Seaman Keil, wore
himself out completely by the exertion; he died
a week later. On the next morning we went
over again to the wreck in order to seek the
weapons that had fallen into the water. You
see, the Arabs dive so well; they fetched up a
considerable lot&mdash;both machine guns, all but
ten of the rifles, though these were, to be sure,
all full of water. Later they frequently failed
to go off when they were used in firing.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sami Bey
becomes
guide.</div>

<p>"Now we numbered, together with the Arabs,
seventy men on the little boat, until evening.
Then we anchored before Konfida, and met
Sami Bey, who is still with us. He had shown
himself useful even before in the service of the
Turkish Government, and has done good service
as guide in the last two months. He is an
active man, thoroughly familiar with the country.
He procured for us a larger boat, of fifty-four
tons, and he himself, with his wife, sailed
alongside on the little sambuk. We sailed
from the 20th to the 24th unmolested to Lith.
There Sami Bey announced that three English
ships were cruising about in order to intercept
us. I therefore advised traveling a bit overland.
I disliked leaving the sea a second time,
but it had to be done."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Travelling
overland.</div>

<p>"Lith is, to be sure, nothing but this," said
M&uuml;cke, with a sweeping gesture toward the
desert through which we were traveling, "and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
therefore it was very difficult to get up a caravan
at once. We remained aboard ship so long.
We marched away on the 28th. We had only
a vague suspicion that the English might have
agents here also. We could travel only at
night, and when we slept or camped around
a spring, there was only a tent for the sick
men. Two days' march from Jeddah, the Turkish
Government, as soon as it had received news
about us, sent us sixteen good camels.</p>

<div class="sidenote">An attack.</div>

<p>"Suddenly, on the night of April 1, things
became uneasy. I was riding at the head of
the column. All our shooting implements were
cleared for action, because there was danger of
an attack by Bedouins, whom the English here
had bribed. When it began to grow a bit light,
I already thought: 'We're through for to-day';
for we were tired&mdash;had been riding eighteen
hours. Suddenly I saw a line flash up before
me, and shots whizzed over our heads. Down
from the camels! Form a fighting line! You
know how quickly it becomes daylight here.
The whole space around the desert hillock was
occupied. Now, up with your bayonets! Rush
'em! * * * They fled, but returned again,
this time from all sides. Several of the gendarmes
that had been given us as an escort are
wounded; the machine gun operator, Rademacher,
falls, killed by a shot through his
heart; another is wounded; Lieutenant Schmidt,
in the rear guard, is mortally wounded&mdash;he
has received a bullet in his chest and abdomen.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A flag
of truce
and a
barricade.</div>

<p>"Suddenly they waved white cloths. The
Sheik, to whom a part of our camels belonged,
went over to them to negotiate, then Sami Bey
and his wife. In the interim we quickly built
a sort of wagon barricade, a circular camp of
camel saddles, rice and coffee sacks, all of
which we filled with sand. We had no shovels,
and had to dig with our bayonets, plates, and
hands. The whole barricade had a diameter of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
about fifty meters. Behind it we dug trenches,
which we deepened even during the skirmish.
The camels inside had to lie down, and thus
served very well as cover for the rear of the
trenches. Then an inner wall was constructed,
behind which we carried the sick men. In the
very centre we buried two jars of water, to
guard us against thirst. In addition we had
ten petroleum cans full of water; all told, a
supply for four days. Late in the evening
Sami's wife came back from the futile negotiations,
alone. She had unveiled for the first
and only time on this day of the skirmish, had
distributed cartridges, and had conducted herself
faultlessly.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Death of
Schmidt
and Rademacher.</div>

<p>"Soon we were able to ascertain the number
of the enemy. There were about 300 men; we
numbered fifty, with twenty-nine guns. In the
night, Lieutenant Schmidt died. We had to dig
his grave with our hands and with our
bayonets, and to eliminate every trace above
it, in order to protect the body. Rademacher
had been buried immediately after the skirmish,
both of them silently, with all honors.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The men
suffer
from
thirst.</div>

<p>"The wounded had a hard time of it. We
had lost our medicine chest in the wreck; we
had only little packages of bandages for skirmishes;
but no probing <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'intrument'">instrument</ins>, no scissors
were at hand. On the next day our men came
up with thick tongues, feverish, and crying
'Water! water!' But each one received only a
little cupful three times a day. If our water
supply was exhausted, we would have to sally
from our camp and fight our way through.
Then we should have gone to pot under superior
numbers. The Arab gendarmes simply
cut the throats of those camels that had been
wounded by shots, and then drank the yellow
water that was contained in the stomachs.
Those fellows can stand anything. At night
we always dragged out the dead camels that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
had served as cover, and had been shot. The
hyenas came, hunting for dead camels. I shot
one of these, taking it for an enemy in the
darkness.</p>

<p>"That continued about three days. On the
third day there were new negotiations. Now
the Bedouins demanded arms no longer, but
only money. This time the negotiations took
place across the camp wall. When I declined,
the Bedouin said: 'Beaucoup de combat,' (lots
of fight.) I replied:</p>

<p>"'Please go to it!'</p>

<div class="sidenote">Troops
of the Emir
of Mecca.</div>

<p>"We had only a little ammunition left, and
very little water. Now it really looked as if
we would soon be dispatched. The mood of
the men was pretty dismal. Suddenly, at about
10 o'clock in the morning, there bobbed up in
the north two riders on camels, waving white
cloths. Soon afterward there appeared, coming
from the same direction, far back, a long
row of camel troops, about a hundred; they
draw rapidly near by, ride singing toward us,
in a picturesque train. They were the messengers
and troops of the Emir of Mecca.</p>

<p>"Sami Bey's wife, it developed, had, in the
course of the first negotiations, dispatched an
Arab boy to Jeddah. From that place the
Governor had telegraphed to the Emir. The
latter at once sent camel troops, with his
two sons and his personal surgeon; the
elder, Abdullah, conducted the negotiations;
the surgeon acted as interpreter, in French.
Now things proceeded in one-two-three order,
and the whole Bedouin band speedily disappeared.
From what I learned later, I know
definitely that they had been corrupted with
bribes by the English. They knew when and
where we would pass and they had made all
preparations. Now our first act was a rush
for water; then we cleared up our camp, but
had to harness our camels ourselves, for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
camel drivers had fled at the very beginning
of the skirmish. More than thirty camels were
dead. The saddles did not fit, and my men
know how to rig up schooners, but not camels.
Much baggage remained lying in the sand for
lack of pack animals.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The party
reaches
Mecca.</div>

<p>"Then, under the safe protection of Turkish
troops, we got to Jeddah. There the authorities
and the populace received us very well.
From there we proceeded in nineteen days,
without mischance, by sailing boat to Elwesh,
and under abundant guard with Suleiman
Pasha in a five-day caravan journey toward
this place, to El Ula, and now we are seated
at last in the train and are riding toward
Germany&mdash;into the war at last!"</p>

<p>"Was not the war you had enough?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it," replied the youngest Lieutenant;
"the <i>Emden</i> simply captured ships
each time; only a single time, at Penang, was
it engaged in battle, and I wasn't present on
that occasion. War? No, that is just to begin
for us now."</p>

<div class="sidenote">M&uuml;cke's
great
task.</div>

<p>"My task since November," said M&uuml;cke, "has
been to bring my men as quickly as possible
to Germany against the enemy. Now, at last,
I can do so."</p>

<p>"And what do you desire for yourself?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"For myself," he laughed, and the blue eyes
sparkled, "a command in the North Sea."</p>

<p>Japan was bound by alliance with Great
Britain to join with her to attack any aggressor,
and to carry out her pledges she, at the
outbreak of the war, prepared to capture the
German stronghold Tsing-tao, the capital of

<div class="sidenote">Japanese
ultimatum.</div>

<p>Tokyo, capital of Japan, lies at the head
of Tokyo Bay, in the south-east of Nippon.
Its two million inhabitants are distributed
among houses and streets which present
curious intermixtures of Japanese and
European architecture, customs, or science.
The jinrikisha notably has been displaced
largely by tramcars which, carrying all passengers
at a uniform rate of four sen, make it
possible to travel ten miles for a penny. It
is an industrial city, but on account of occasional
earthquakes no very large buildings
line the thoroughfares. The traveller can here
observe to advantage the strange characteristics
of the most stoical race upon earth, or
can contrast, if he will, the courteous, imperturbably
serene disposition of the most martial
nation of the East with the present disposition
of the most rabidly bellicose nation of the
West. When Japanese and German, indeed,
met in conflict before Tsing-tao in the autumn
of 1914, there was seen, in the Japanese soldier,
during a campaign of peculiar hardship and
difficulty, a revival of the qualities of the old
Samurai, with his quiet courage, his burning
patriotism, his patience, his habitual suppression
of emotional display singularly distinct
from those of the modern Goth. Nor was the
statesmanship which brought about that conflict
less admirable. Japan's alliance with
Great Britain was at once a solemn pledge
and the guiding principle of her foreign policy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
August 1914 found British interests and the
vast trade that centred at Hong-kong in
danger: German armed vessels prowled the
seas, and the German naval base of Tsing-tao
was busy with warlike preparations. Great
Britain appealed to Japan to free their joint
commerce from the menace. The Japanese
Prime Minister, Count Okuma, might well
hesitate, however, before recommending intervention.
Was he the right minister to direct a
war? He was nearer eighty than seventy years
old, and recently had been for seven years in
retirement: his Government had a minority
in the Diet, and to the Genro his name was
anathema: he claimed the allegiance of no
party, and the powerful military and naval
clans, Choshiu and Satsuma, were openly
hostile. He had been raised to power a few
months before by public demand for progressive
government. There were considerations
other than domestic or personal, indeed, which
might have tempted some statesmen to hold
their hands. To temporize while events revealed
themselves in Europe would be safer
than immediate action; while to remain neutral
might lead to the transference to the
Japanese of much trade with China now in
British hands, inevitably hampered by the
menace of German commerce-destroyers. Nevertheless,
Count Okuma's Cabinet came to a bold
and loyal decision. Baron Kato, the Foreign
Minister, reassured Great Britain of active
Japanese aid, and on August 15 sent an ultimatum
to Germany. The latter was requested
to withdraw at once all German armed vessels
from Eastern waters, and to deliver to Japan
before September 15 the entire leased territory
of Kiao-chau, with a view to its eventual restoration
to China. The ultimatum was timed to
expire at noon on August 23. That day arrived
without satisfaction having been given<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
to Japan. Within a few hours the 2nd Japanese
squadron steamed off towards Tsing-tao.</p>

<p>Before the outbreak of hostilities with Great
Britain, Vice-Admiral the Graf von Spee, who
commanded the German Pacific squadron, had
steamed away from Tsing-tao with most of his
ships. To use Tsing-tao as a naval base while
engaging in commerce-raiding seemed a sound
and a practicable plan, since the British and
Australian naval forces, though superior, were
hardly strong enough simultaneously to blockade
the harbour and to search the seas. The
plan was, however, rendered impossible by the
Japanese ultimatum, and the Admiral, after
having lingered for some weeks in the Western
Pacific, departed for other seas and other adventures.
Such was the result of Japan's action,
and thus dangerous were the tactics that
Japan's action had frustrated. For Tsing-tao,
situated upon one of the two peninsulas,
divided by two miles of waterway, enclosing
the bay of Kiao-chau, with its safe and spacious
anchorage for vessels of any size, constituted
one of the most important naval bases
on the Chinese coast. It had, indeed, been
described as the key to Northern China. Dominating
the eastern coast of the Shantung
peninsula, the port formed the centre of the
semicircular area known as Kiao-chau, extending
on a radius of 32 miles around the shores
of the bay, with a population of 60,000. This
area was, under the Chinese German agreement
as to Tsing-tao, influenced and controlled by
Germany, though not strictly subject to her,
and regarded as neutral territory. Its surface
was mainly mountainous and bare, though the
lowlands were well cultivated, but in parts it
was rich in mineral wealth, large but undeveloped
supplies of coal being present. In
winter the port, connected to the junction of
Tsi-nan by a German-built railway, was the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
natural outlet for the trade of Northern China.
The heights which surrounded the bay offered
admirable sites for fortification, while the
land-approaches to Tsing-tao were guarded by
formidable defences stretched across its peninsula.
In many quarters the stronghold was regarded
as a second Port Arthur. The Germans
had paid particular attention to defence,
so much so, indeed, that over five-sixths of
the white inhabitants were engaged in military
occupations. Five thousand German marines
constituted the normal garrison, though the
outbreak of war in August called about a
thousand more men&mdash;volunteers, reservists,
and sailors&mdash;to the colours. The complement
of the <i>Kaiserin Elizabeth</i>, an Austrian cruiser
sheltering in the harbour, left for Tientsin,
having received orders to disarm their ship,
but returned in time to join the defenders. The
garrison was amply provisioned for five or six
months, and well provided with weapons,
stores, and munitions. Most of the German
ships off the Chinese coast at the outbreak of
war, indeed, had made immediately for Tsing-tao,
and discharged upon its wharves many
thousand tons of cargo. When war with Japan
became inevitable, therefore, the defenders
could anticipate a successful resistance, provided
the expected instantaneous victories in
Europe materialized. Elaborate preparations
were made for the defence. The harbour mouth
was blocked by three sunken vessels, enabling
only small craft to enter. Chinese villages
within the leased territory, and the bridge
where the railway crossed the boundary, were
destroyed, partial compensation being paid to
the inhabitants. Native labourers were engaged
to throw up earthworks to strengthen
the town fortifications. Many foreigners,
women, children, and non-combatants, meanwhile,
had left the town. On Friday evening,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
August 21, at roll-call, the Governor, Captain
Meyer-Waldeck, read out a message from the
German Emperor exhorting the garrison to defend
the town to their utmost, and to do their
'duty to the last'. It was listened to stoically.
The following day a diversion occurred which
opened hostilities propitiously for the Germans.
The British destroyer <i>Kennet</i>, encountering
the German destroyer <i>S. 90</i> off the coast, gave
chase. The <i>S. 90</i> immediately made for port,
and the <i>Kennet</i>, in the ardour of pursuit,
closed in unawares within range of the German
land batteries. The latter opened fire,
and before she could draw off the <i>Kennet</i> sustained
ten casualties, though little material
damage. Next day the term of the Japanese
ultimatum expired. It was doubtful at what
point the Japanese would begin operations,
or what tactics they would adopt. The fear
was prevalent among Germans that the
enemy would enter Chinese territory to reach
the town from the land: newspapers under
German influence, indeed, circulating in
Chinese coast towns, started a press campaign
with the object of stirring the Chinese Government
to oppose by force any Japanese landing
in her territory. Outposts were placed by
the Germans along the shores of the neutral
zone to watch for developments: they descried,
on August 24, the approach of Japanese warships.</p>

<p>Vice-Admiral Sadakichi Kato, who commanded
the approaching squadron, immediately
upon arrival took measures to protect
himself against danger from mines. Seven islets
clustering round the mouth of Kiao-chau
Bay were occupied, to form a convenient local
naval base, while mine-sweepers swept the surrounding
seas. No less than a thousand mines
were taken from the water. A blockade of the
whole Kiao-chau coast was declared, as commencing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
from 9 a.m., August 27, and war vessels
patrolled the shores, some seventy miles
long. Action soon began, and continued during
ensuing days, with shells that at intervals
screamed towards the town. The position was,
however, reconnoitred carefully. Japanese airmen
went up frequently to scan the fortifications
and to drop bombs. All protruding structures,
spires and factory-chimneys, had been
levelled to the ground by the Germans so as to
afford no mark for fire. Bombs were dropped
on the railway station and on one of the numerous
barrack buildings. The operations continued
spasmodically into September, while
Kato was awaiting the approach by land of
a co-operating army, which had now disembarked
on the northern coast of the Shantung
peninsula, about 150 miles due north of Tsing-tao.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Landing
effected.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Floods
hinder
advance.</div>

<p>The landing was effected on September 2,
without hindrance or opposition on the part of
the Chinese. The Government, following the
precedent of the Russo-Japanese War, immediately
published a declaration refusing to hold
itself responsible for the obligations of strict
neutrality in areas that formed, within Lung-kow,
Lai-chau, and the neighbourhood of Kiao-chau
Bay, passage-ways essential to the belligerent
troops. It was, of course, incumbent
upon the Powers involved to respect Chinese
property and administrative rights. Japan,
therefore, was permitted to make use of the
main roads to transport an army to the rear
of Tsing-tao. The forces landed composed a
division numbering 23,000, and commanded by
Lieutenant-General Mitsuomi Kamio. An advance-guard
was sent forward without delay,
but soon found its way rendered impassable by
torrential floods which at this time swept down
upon and devastated the province of Shantung,
bridges, roads, and even villages being submerged<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
and destroyed, with great loss of life,
largely owing to Chinese official incompetence.
The Japanese, after covering 20 kilometres in
two days, reached a stream so swollen that
crossing was impossible. The artillery had to
return to Lung-kow. German diplomacy, meanwhile,
exasperated at its inability to prevent a
Japanese landing, had not been inactive.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Chinese
neutrality.</div>

and

<div class="sidenote">Japanese
advance.</div>

<p>The German and Austrian ministers at Peking,
on hearing of the Japanese landing, protested
strongly. China, it was claimed, ought
to have forestalled and resisted the landing,
but instead had deliberately extended the war-zone
in order to facilitate Japanese movements.
She would be held responsible for any injury
to the German cause or property. To this
China replied that, if it was incumbent upon
her to prevent by force Japan operating in her
territory, it was equally her duty to prevent
by force Germany fortifying and defending
Tsing-tao. China had endeavoured, indeed, but
unsuccessfully, to preclude belligerent operations
in her territory: only after the Japanese
landing, when she was powerless to do otherwise,
had she extended the zone of war. As
to the responsibility, she reiterated her previous
declaration. The baffled Germans fell
back on threats: the right was reserved to visit
upon China dire consequences for her alleged
breach of neutrality. The incident, thrown
into striking contrast with Germany's offer to
Belgium, marked the unscrupulousness of German
diplomacy, but stirred also many doubts
among the foreign communities in China, in
which the British, allied as they were to the
Japanese, formed a predominating element. An
anomaly of the situation was that British local
interests had long conflicted with Japanese
national interests. Japan's activities had, at
every stage of her recent history, reduced British
opportunities. Japanese trader competed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
with British trader for the markets of China,
and Japan's share of the annual trade expansion
was increasing, that of Great Britain decreasing.
High tariffs and preferential rates
had closed Corea and Manchuria to British enterprise.
It is easy to estimate in what commercial
jealousy and rivalry such circumstances
had resulted. While the expediency
of the British-Japanese alliance was fully recognized,
and its consequences admitted to be
the freedom of the China seas from menace of
commerce-destroyers, nevertheless the fact remained
that the hostilities against Tsing-tao
would constitute a fresh impulse to Japanese
expansion. The operations in Shantung were
watched with critical eyes by many British in
the foreign settlements of China. The floods
had, meanwhile, subsided considerably, and on
September 12 Japanese cavalry reached Tsimo,
ten miles outside the Kiao-chau zone. No trace
of the enemy north of the Pai-sha River had
been seen, beyond a German aeroplane that occasionally
passed overhead on reconnoitring
flights. On the following day a number of
sharp skirmishes with outposts occurred, and
one Japanese patrol found its way to the small
town of Kiao-chau, situated at the head of the
bay, some 22 miles from Tsing-tao itself. The
brushes with the Germans became of daily occurrence,
and in one of them a high official of
the German Legation at Peking, who had volunteered
for service, was killed. On September
17 the Japanese attacked Wang-ko-huang, 13
miles from Tsimo, the enemy being in a fortified
position and provided with machine-guns.
At sunset, however, they abandoned the village
and withdrew under cover of darkness, leaving
behind quantities of equipment and supplies.
A little later a development came about that
brought the dissatisfaction of British traders
to a head. About September 18, after hostile<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
patrols had been driven away from the shore by
the fire of destroyers, Japanese artillery and
troops were landed at Laoshan Bay, north of
Tsing-tao, just within the leased territory.
Why was it necessary that troops should have
been landed on the northern shore of the peninsula
of Shantung, 150 miles from their objective,
when guns could be disembarked with perfect
safety on the eastern shore, not 40 miles
from the objective, and within the German
zone?</p>

<div class="sidenote">A British
force
co-operates.</div>

<p>The British were not as critical of Japan's
strategy as they were suspicious of her policy.
Dark suggestions got afoot that she had
ulterior designs upon the whole Chinese province
of Shantung. Such views could not
but have reached the ears of the British authorities
at Wei-hei-wei and elsewhere, nor
could they have been deaf to previous murmurs.
Diplomatic circles, however, could extend little
sympathy to the critics. Nevertheless, it was
undeniable that the latter were aggrieved, and
that their attitude might produce unfortunate
effects. If Great Britain herself took some
share in the Tsing-tao operations, greater sympathy
with their purpose might be induced, and
a better state of feeling in the Orient between
the two peoples might possibly result.
It must have been some aim such as this that
prompted the dispatch of a British force to the
Tsing-tao area to co-operate with General
Kamio, a step which the earlier symptoms of the
British discontent cannot but have influenced.
On September 19, however, 1,000 of the 2nd
South Wales Borderers, a force so small as to
be nominal, under Brigadier-General Barnardiston,
left Tientsin and proceeded to Wei-hei-wei.
Transport mules having here been taken
on board, the expedition on September 22
coasted down the eastern shore of Shantung,
and next day landed at Laoshan Bay. A<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
month later, as will be seen, they were joined
by 500 of the 36th Sikhs.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Faint
opposition.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Artillery
battle.</div>

<p>Meanwhile, it was probably about this time,
or shortly after, that the <i>Triumph</i>, a British
battleship of nearly 12,000 tons displacement,
19-1/2 knots speed, and four 10-inch guns primary
armament, joined the Japanese squadron
off Tsing-tao. A spasmodic bombardment had
been maintained during the preceding weeks,
and seaplanes had been busy, bombing and
range-finding. The wireless station, the electric-power
station, and several ships in harbour
were damaged by explosive missiles.
Little could be done, however, from the sea
alone, and the attack by land, owing largely
to transport difficulties, had still to develop.
But the weather was now improving considerably.
Another set-back to Japanese military
ardour was, indeed, constituted by the marked
reluctance of the Germans to form a line of resistance.
German outposts, upon encountering
hostile patrols, invariably retired after offering
faint opposition. When the British troops,
after a circuitous march of 40 miles, much hampered
by bad roads, came up in the rear of the
Japanese, then preparing to assault the enemy's
advanced positions on high ground between the
rivers Pai-sha and Li-tsun, the part that it had
been arranged they should take in the Japanese
attack, on September 26, fell through owing
to a disinclination of the Germans to fight.
Their resistance was so meagre that the Allies
were hardly engaged, and next day gained
without difficulty the easterly banks of the Li-tsun
and Chang-tsun rivers, only seven miles
north-east of Tsing-tao. The enemy at all points
fell back, and the advance upon the town continued.
The Japanese had now drawn their
lines across the neck of the narrow peninsula
upon which Tsing-tao stands. There were indications
that the main forces were now in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
contact. The only obstacle, but a formidable
one, between the invaders and the forts themselves
was constituted by the dominating height
of Prince Heinrich Hill, from whose crest,
rising some five miles from the town, all the
forts could be bombarded. General Kamio estimated
that three days of fighting would be required
for its capture: it was as all-important
to the defence as to the attack, and was sure
to be strongly held. The forts themselves, of
the latest type, were elaborately constructed,
and equipped with concrete and steel cupolas,
mounting high calibre pieces. They commanded
both landward and seaward approaches
to the town, those nearest the invading
Japanese being situated upon, and named
Moltke Berg, Bismarck Berg, and Iltis Berg.
Earth redoubts and trenches between formed
the German line of defence. Plans for the most
considerable engagement, the assault of Prince
Heinrich Hill, that had so far taken place, to
begin on Sunday, September 27, were made by
the Japanese General. It developed more
speedily than had been expected. German artillery
opened a terrific cannonade upon the
Japanese lines, while three warships shelled the
attacking right wing from the bay. The German
fire was heavy and accurate. Japanese
warships and aeroplanes, and also the British
battleship <i>Triumph</i>, however, created a diversion
that relieved the assaulting forces. Two
of the forts were shelled from the sea, and suffered
serious injury, a barrack-house and other
buildings being, moreover, damaged. For many
hours the great guns, thundering their challenges
from sea and land and estuary, maintained
continual uproar. Darkness began to
gather. Fighting continued into the night, and
early next morning was renewed. But the defenders
seemed to lack enthusiasm. It is
doubtful, indeed, whether their forces were sufficiently<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
numerous to hold with strength their
advanced positions, and at the same time to
man adequately their main fortified positions.
During the morning of the 28th the Germans
withdrew from Prince Heinrich Hill, leaving
fifty of their number and four machine-guns in
Japanese hands, and many dead upon the
slopes. The Japanese casualties numbered 150.
By noon the whole position was in the attackers'
hands, and the beleaguered town,
visible from the height, was now face to face
with siege. German officers who knew all the
points, weak and strong, of the defences, could
not but realize their inability to withstand the
siege guns which Japan would sooner or later
bring to the attack. But the heavy artillery
was yet far away. A month was to elapse before
the pieces could be dragged across the difficult
country, and emplaced in prepared positions
on Prince Heinrich Hill.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The siege
continues.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Gunboats
sunk.</div>

<p>This month, which covered the whole of October,
saw many interesting incidents, and betrayed
no signs of idleness on the part of besiegers
or besieged. The Germans, indeed,
proved extraordinarily prodigal in ammunition,
firing on an average 1,000 to 1,500 shells
daily, a fact which lent support to the current
view that, while undesirous of incurring their
emperor's displeasure, they realized the hopelessness,
so far as Tsing-tao was concerned, of
their emperor's cause. Warships in the bay
assisted the cannonade from the forts, and
Lieutenant von Pluschow, the airman of the
single aeroplane the town possessed, ventured
forth at intervals to reconnoitre or to bomb.
Life in the town itself continued to be quite
normal. Japanese and British, meanwhile,
drew their lines closer and closer to the fortress
by sap and mine, though hindered greatly by
terrible weather, and occasionally having slight
encounters with the enemy. In one of these,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
on October 5, a German night-attack was heavily
repulsed, forty-seven dead being left behind
by the attackers. At sea the operations were
also spasmodic. At the end of September a
landing force occupied Lao-she harbour, in the
vicinity of Tsing-tao, where four abandoned
field-guns were taken possession of. Mine-sweeping
had constantly to be maintained, under
fire from the shore, and proved a dangerous
task. Several vessels thus engaged were
sunk or damaged, though with comparatively
few casualties, through coming into contact
with mines. Some German gunboats, however,
among them the <i>Cormoran</i> and the <i>Iltis</i>, were
apparently sunk about this time, either deliberately
by the Germans, or from the fire
of the Japanese guns. A torpedo flotilla bombarded
one of the barracks, moreover, to some
effect, while Japanese aeroplanes were also active.
Von Pluschow twice attempted to attack
vessels of the blockading squadron, but unsuccessfully,
and on one occasion a Japanese
aeroplane pursuing him gave a German balloon,
floating captive above the town, some
critical moments before it could be hauled to
safety. A few days later, about October 7, the
rope which held this balloon was, during the
spasmodic firing, severed by a shot, and the
great bag floated away, apparently across the
bay in the direction of Kiao-chau town and
the railway line inland. In this quarter, indeed,
over the line itself, serious friction had
arisen between the Japanese and the Chinese
authorities.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Railway
seized.</div>

<div class="sidenote">China
protests.</div>

<p>The line ran from Tsing-tao and Kiao-chau
to the junction of Tsi-nan, a distance of about
250 miles, passing through the towns of Wei-hsien
and Tsing-chau. It was German built
and almost wholly German owned. From some
points of view it might reasonably be said to
constitute an adjunct, if not a part, of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
leased territory itself. In any case the Japanese
claimed that, since the outbreak of war,
the line had been consistently utilized to bring
reservists, supplies, and ammunition to the
town. The Austrian crew of the disarmed
<i>Kaiserin Elizabeth</i>, both when they left and
later returned to Tsing-tao, had used this
means of transit. The railway, being still under
German control, constituted a menace in
the Japanese rear, which the latter, upon consolidating
their position towards the end of
September, took measures to remove. After
occupying Wei-hsien, they began to arrange for
the seizure of the whole line as far as Tsi-nan
itself. Hints of such action drew forth protests
from China, whose Government, however,
adopted too compromising an attitude. The
Japanese Government was firm. China's right
to formal protest was admitted, but the occupation
was stated to be an urgent military
necessity, and without any prejudice to
Chinese claims after the war. Since China
was unable to enforce the neutrality of the
line, flagrantly violated by the Germans, the
Japanese had no alternative but to bring it
under their own control. The Chino-German
Treaty of 1898 and the German Government's
charter clearly proved that the railway was
essentially German. A compromise, hastened
by the unhesitating and thorough measures
taken by the Japanese to effect the occupation,
was arrived at. The Japanese were temporarily
to control the administration, while the
Chinese conducted the traffic, of the railway.
Its fate, since China did not admit the contention
that it was purely German, was to be
decided after the war. A bellicose attitude
noticeable in Chinese military circles became
very marked when, three days later, on October
6, unquestionably in breach of the arrangement,
Japanese soldiers arrived at Tsi-nan,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
and took over the control of the rolling
stock on the Shantung line. It was alleged
at Peking that this force had declared martial
law in the town, which contained, indeed, many
German sympathizers who, rumour added, had
destroyed several collieries there in their
anxiety to obstruct the Allies. But the Chinese
Government submitted under further strong
protest, and with a request that the troops
should be withdrawn. The Japanese action
occasioned, however, further distrust among
British residents in the Orient. Meanwhile,
a second British force, consisting of 500
Sikhs, was being prepared to reinforce General
Barnardiston.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Bombardment
on

birthday.</div>

<p>At one o'clock on October 12, Captain Meyer-Waldeck,
the Governor of Tsing-tao, received
a joint wireless message from the commanders
of the besieging troops and the blockading
squadron, offering a safe escort out of the town
of Tientsin of neutrals and non-combatants.
He at once assented. Delegates met next day
at ten o'clock to discuss details, and on the
15th the American consul, accompanied by
German women and children and Chinese subjects,
left the town. On the previous day there
had been a combined sea and air attack upon
forts Iltis and Kaiser, in which the <i>Triumph</i>
participated and suffered the only Allied
casualties. It is recorded that, before reopening
bombardment after the departure of the
non-combatants, the Japanese, ever polite, signalled
'Are you now quite ready, gentlemen?'
For reply a German sniper, taking careful but
faulty aim, sent a bullet which removed three
out of the eleven hairs on the signalman's moustache.
Two days later, days notable for torrential
rains, which intensified the discomforts
of the troops ashore, the Japanese suffered
a severe naval loss. The <i>Takachiho</i>, an old
cruiser of some 3,000 tons, which had seen service<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
in the Chino-Japanese War, was on patrol
duty on Saturday night, October 17, when she
fouled a mine, released by and adrift in the
rough seas. Destroyers hastened to her aid,
but rescue work was difficult in the darkness
and the heavy weather. The cruiser sank
rapidly. Two hundred and seventy-one officers
and seamen lost their lives. The rough weather
which contributed to the disaster continued
with little break, and hindered operations, till
the end of the month. The landing of the Sikh
contingent at Laoshan Bay on October 21 was,
indeed, attended by great difficulties and some
loss of life. A strong southerly gale had raised
high seas, and enormous lighters and sampans,
employed for disembarkation, were thrown
high and dry upon the beach. Sixteen Japanese
were drowned in trying to save other boats
that broke loose. The Sikhs got safely ashore,
but next morning again the winds blew and the
rains descended, and the camping-ground was
soon a miry pool. Circumstances other than
the weather, however, helped to put the British
officers out of humour. Trouble ahead
threatened in connexion with transport arrangements.
While the Chinese carts and
drivers, brought hurriedly from Tientsin, were
doubtfully reliable, many of the mules were
raw and quite unused to harness. When a
start for the front was preparing on the morning
of the 23rd, it was found that the best of
the harness, which had been purchased from
peasants in the locality, had been stolen in the
night by the people who had brought it in,
and that what was left was tied up with string.
The column, however, at length set off, and
made a march memorable for hardship and
difficulty. From Laoshan to Lutin, where a
metalled road began, was 30 miles, crossed by
a track formed at one time by quagmire, at
another by slippery boulders. During eleven<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
hours 6 miles were covered, by which time the
Sikhs were completely exhausted with digging
carts or mules out of the mud, hauling them
out with drag-ropes, reloading overturned
carts, or unloading those immovable. Next
day the column was on the road at seven
o'clock, and covered 13 miles. So deep was
the mud in parts that when, owing to the
rotten harness giving way, a mule would occasionally
lurch forward suddenly and walk
away by itself, the body of the cart would be
left floating on the surface. One cart was
pulled completely off its axles by a squad of
men, and slid along admirably for a considerable
distance. Seventy Chinese wheelbarrows,
however, obtained from a Japanese d&eacute;p&ocirc;t,
rendered invaluable aid on this day. Tsimo,
the halting-place, was reached in the evening,
and next day, after the first ten miles, saw
plain sailing. A few days later, on October 30,
after the Sikhs had rested and recovered, the
whole British force, now some 1,500 strong,
moved up to the front in readiness for the bombardment
of Tsing-tao, which had been arranged
to begin next morning in celebration of
the birthday of the Mikado. Siege artillery,
150 pieces, including six 28-cm. howitzers and
some heavy naval guns, had now been brought
up and placed in position. The shelling was
timed to start, in royal salute, at dawn.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Oil-tanks
blaze.</div>

<p>Men who, stationed upon Prince Heinrich
Hill, could look below upon the doomed town,
athwart the narrowing peninsula, with the sea,
studded with grey warships, surrounding, had
before them a wonderful spectacle as the morning
sun, rising from the Pacific, slowly dispersed
the darkness. The thunder of the great
guns broke suddenly upon that stillness which
only dawn knows, and their discharges flashed
redly on the darkling slopes. The Japanese
shooting, it is related, displayed remarkable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
accuracy, some of the first projectiles bursting
upon the enormous oil-tanks of the Standard
Oil Company and the Asiatic Petroleum Company.
A blaze roared skywards, and for many
hours the heavens were darkened by an immense
cloud of black petroleum smoke which
hung like a pall over the town. Shells passing
over these fires drew up columns of flame to
a great height. Chinese coolies could be seen
running before the spreading and burning oil.
Fires broke out also on the wharves of the
outer harbour, in which during the day a gunboat,
apparently damaged fatally by a shot
which carried away her funnel, disappeared.
The redoubts and infantry works particularly
were heavily bombarded. On the left of the
German line 100 Chinese in the village of Tao-tung-chien
were unfortunately caught by shell-fire
directed on the redoubt close at hand, while
the fort of Siao-chau-shan, near by, was set
afire. The tops of several of the forts were
soon concealed by clouds of dust and smoke.
A heavy fusillade was concentrated upon an
observation point which the defenders had constructed
on a hill in the town, and had considerable
effect. The Germans did not on this
first day of general bombardment reply strongly,
two only of the forts persistently firing.
At length the sun sank and night obscured the
conflict. It had been a bad day for the besieged:
and dismantled guns, shattered concrete
platforms and entrenchments, devastated
barbed-wire entanglements, augured the town's
approaching fate.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Kaiserin

<div class="sidenote">Night
activity.</div>

<p>The bombardment continued for a week.
During that period the Japanese and British
guns, directed from land and sea by a balloon,
by aeroplanes, or by observation stations on
the hills, in daytime thundered incessantly.
The German shelling, though severe, was far
less heavy, because, it is said, the men in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
forts, sheltering most of the time in bomb-proof
caverns, issued forth only at night, and
during pauses of the Japanese to return the
fire. The airman von Pluschow actively directed
the replies. The latter seemed not, indeed,
impartially distributed. The marked attention
paid to British troops and ships afforded
an illustration of that attitude of
peculiar malevolence which Germans have
adopted towards the British nation and name.
The German airman singled out the British
camp, recognizable by its white tents, for his
bombs, while for the German artillery it had
an inordinate attraction. Officers on board the
<i>Triumph</i>, moreover, observed that the largest
German guns, of 12-inch calibre, were consistently
directed upon their vessel. But of
many projectiles one only, which struck the
mast, being fired from Hui-tchien-huk, proved
effective. This hit, however, caused rejoicing
in Tsing-tao which, it is asserted, would not
have been equalled by the sinking of a Japanese
Dreadnought. The <i>Triumph</i> singled out for
attack Fort Bismarck especially, and two of
the German 6-inch guns were early put out of
action. The British gunners adopted the ingenious
plan of heeling their ship by five
degrees, and bombarding the enemy, from sight
strips specially calculated, without exposing
themselves or their weapons. It became customary
aboard to call the bombardment 'pressing
the enemy' from an exhortation sent by
the Japanese Crown Prince to 'press the
enemy, braving all hardships'. Ashore, indeed,
the pressure on the enemy developed steadily
as the days passed. On November 2 the Austrian
cruiser <i>Kaiserin Elizabeth</i>, which had,
with the German gunboats still afloat, been
engaging vigorously in the fighting, sank, having
probably been blown up deliberately, and
the floating dock also disappeared. Iltis Fort,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
moreover, was silenced, two guns being smashed
and ammunition giving out, and Japanese infantry
advanced and captured an eminence in
German hands. On another ridge, however,
hard by the silenced fort, some German naval
gunners carried out a ruse which saved for
the present both their position and their battery,
composed of naval 9-cm. pieces, which
were exposed dangerously to fire from sea and
land. Lieutenant von Trendel, in command,
during the night constructed wooden models of
cannon, which he placed in position 200 yards
from his real guns. Next morning he exploded
powder near by, and drew the fire of the besiegers,
attracted by the flashes, upon the dummies.
That day the wireless and electric power
stations were wrecked, and large attacking
forces crept further forward, despite severe
fire, and entrenched closer to the enemy's lines.
In the evening and night the latter showed
special activity, star rockets and other fireworks
being used to illumine the opposing positions,
which were heavily fusilladed. A German
night-attack was delivered, but was repulsed.
Next day, the 4th, and on the two following
days, progress was maintained. The
Allied trenches were pushed forward until they
were right up to and almost half round the
nearest German forts. Many casualties were
suffered, but the German fire was kept down
by the Japanese guns, whose accuracy was remarkable.
The weather conditions were unfavourable,
high winds and heavy rains prevailing,
and the troops in the trenches had to
endure hard privations. So effective was the
bombardment, however, that during November
5 and 6 plans were prepared for the final assault.
It was arranged that a general infantry
attack should be made as soon as practicable.
The garrisons in the forts, meanwhile, were beginning
to exhaust their ammunition, of which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
they had been, during the preliminary operations,
strangely prodigal. Guns lay silent for
other reasons than structural injury, though
the latter cause, indeed, was frequent, a single
shot, in one case, from the <i>Suwo</i>, the Japanese
flagship, having destroyed a 24-cm. gun and
killed eight men on Fort Hui-tchien-huk. In
the town itself the streets, not immune from
falling projectiles, were deserted, and the only
centre of social intercourse and conviviality
was the German Club, where regularly officers
or non-combatants slipped in for dinner, luncheon,
or a glass of beer. But it was realized
that the end was not far distant.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Central

<div class="sidenote">Mass attack
on

<div class="sidenote">The
white
flag.</div>

<p>Early in the morning of November 6 the airman
von Pluschow flew away across Kiao-chau
Bay, and did not return. He escaped with the
Governor's last dispatches into Chinese territory,
where his machine was interned. That
day and night saw no cessation of the firing,
the guns of the defenders still roaring at intervals.
About an hour after midnight the first
impulse of the general attack took effect. While
a particularly heavy artillery fire kept the Germans
in their bomb-proof shelters, the central
redoubt of the first line of defence, which had
been badly shattered by the bombardment, was
rushed by a storming party headed by General
Yoshimi Yamada. Engineers had in the darkness
sapped right up to the barbed-wire entanglements,
which being cut provided way for
the infantry, who, while part held the enemy
in front, rushed the redoubt on both flanks.
Two hundred prisoners were taken, and the
Japanese flag was hoisted. The besiegers were
through the German line, but the position had
to be consolidated, or disaster would follow.
Danger from the flank was, however, soon obviated
by advances in other parts of the line. Just
after five o'clock a battery on Shao-tan Hill
was captured; half an hour later another battery<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
in Tao-tung-chien redoubt was taken, and
Fort Chung-shan-wa, the base of the German
right wing, fell. The shadows were still dense,
and the final phase of the siege, viewed from
Prince Heinrich Hill, presented a sight brilliant
with many flashes and flaming fireworks,
and a sound dominated by the thunder of the
batteries. But dawn, as the besiegers began
in mass to close in upon the main line of forts
Iltis, Moltke, and Bismarck, was breaking. It
was decided to storm these positions forthwith,
since the German fire, owing to exhaustion of
the ammunition, was dying away. Governor
Meyer-Waldeck, who had been wounded, realized
now that further resistance was futile.
Shortly before six o'clock he sent Major von
Kayser, his adjutant, accompanied by another
officer and a trumpeter, from the staff headquarters
bearing the white flag: at the same
time a signal of surrender was made from the
Observatory. This was not, however, observed,
while von Kayser's party, coming under fire,
was dispersed by a shell which killed the trumpeter
and the adjutant's horse. Meanwhile,
Japanese and British were closing in, and were
tensely awaiting the final assault. It was never
made. Soon after seven o'clock a welcome sight
relaxed the tension of the troops, torn, dirty,
and weary, calling forth cheers from the
British, and shouts of 'Banzai!' from the
Japanese. The campaign was over: Tsing-tao
had fallen. White flags were fluttering from
the forts.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Terms of
capitulation.</div>

<div class="sidenote">War

<div class="sidenote">Cost of

<p>That evening delegates from the two armies
met and signed the terms of capitulation, which
were unconditional. Honours of war were accorded
the defenders, the Governor and his
officers being permitted to retain their swords.
The Allies marched into the town, and on
November 10 the garrison was formally transferred.
Over 4,000 Germans were sent to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
Japan as prisoners, and large quantities of war
material were confiscated. The captures included
30 field-guns, 100 machine-guns, 2,500
rifles, 40 motor-cars, &pound;1,200 in bullion, and
15,000 tons of coal. All ships in harbour, and
also the floating dock, had been destroyed, but
it seemed probable that the <i>Kaiserin Elizabeth</i>
could be successfully raised. Sufficient provisions
were found to feed 5,000 persons for three
months, and the victors were able to regale
their appetites with luxuries such as butter,
crab, or salmon, which were plentiful. Looting,
however, was strictly forbidden. For fastidious
persons the bath, after many weeks, was again
available, and proved, indeed, in view of steady
accumulations of mud, a salutary course. Measures,
meanwhile, were at once taken to restore
the town to its normal condition. The troops
and sailors were employed in removing d&eacute;bris
or undischarged land and sea mines. Another
Japanese gunboat was sunk, and several officers
and men lost their lives, while engaged in this
dangerous work. The victory had to be paid
for, indeed, with a heavy toll of life and limb.
The Japanese casualties numbered 236 killed
and 1,282 wounded; the British, 12 killed and
53 wounded. On November 16 the Allies formally
took possession of Tsing-tao; and a memorial
service was held for the dead.</p>

<p>The plan of breaking through the Straits of

<h2>GALLIPOLI</h2>

<h3>A. JOHN GALLISHAW</h3>


<div class="sidenote">The Newfoundlanders
in the
War.</div>

<p>Husky, steel-muscled lumbermen; brawny,
calloused-handed fishermen; loose-jointed,
easy-swinging trappers; athletes from the
city foot-ball and <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'hocky'">hockey</ins> teams; and gawky,
long-armed farmers joined the First Newfoundland
Regiment at the outbreak of war. A rigid
medical examination sorted out the best of
them, and ten months of bayonet fighting,
physical drill, and twenty-mile route marches
over Scottish hills had molded these into trim,
erect, bronzed soldiers. They were garrisoning
Edinburgh Castle when word came of the landing
of the Australians and New-Zealanders at
Gallipoli. At Ypres the Canadians had just
then recaptured their guns and made for themselves
a deathless name.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Not militaristic.</div>

<p>So the Newfoundlanders felt that as colonials
they had been overlooked. They were not militaristic
and hated the ordinary routine of army
life, but they wanted to do their share. That
was the spirit all through the regiment. It was
the spirit that possessed them on the long-waited-for
day at Aldershot when Kitchener
himself pronounced them "just the men I want
for the Dardanelles." That day at Aldershot
every man was given a chance to go back to
Newfoundland. They had enlisted for one year
only, and could demand to be sent home at the
end of the year; and when Kitchener reviewed
them ten months of that year had gone.</p>


<div class="sidenote">Re-enlistment
at
Aldershot.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The desire
to get to
the front.</div>

<p>With the chance to go home in his grasp,
every man of the first battalion reenlisted for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
the duration of war. And it is on record, to
their eternal honor, that during the week preceding
their departure from Aldershot breaches
of discipline were unknown, for over their
heads hung the fear that they would be punished
by being kept back from active service.
To break a rule that week carried with it the
suspicion of cowardice. This was the more
remarkable because many of the men were
fishermen, trappers, hunters, and lumbermen
who until their enlistment had said "Sir" to
no man, and who gloried in the reputation
given them by one inspecting officer as "the
most undisciplined lot he had ever seen." From
the day the Canadians left Salisbury Plain to
take their places in the trenches in Flanders
the Newfoundlanders were obsessed by one
idea: they had to get to the front.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Troop-ships
in
Mudros
Harbor.</div>

<p>So it was with eleven hundred of such eager
spirits that I lined up, on a Sunday evening
early in August, 1915, on the deck of the troop-ship
in Mudros Harbor, which is the center of
the historic island of Lemnos, about fifty miles
from Gallipoli. Around us lay all sorts of
ships, from ocean leviathans to tiny launches
and rowboats. There were gray-and-black-painted
troopers, their rails lined with soldiers;
immense four-funneled men-of-war; and brightly
lighted, white hospital ships, with their red
crosses outlined in electric lights. The landing
officer left us in a little motor-boat. We
watched him glide slowly shoreward, where we
could faintly discern through the dusk the
white of the tents that were the headquarters
for the people at Lemnos; to the right of the
tents we could see the hospital for wounded
Australians and New-Zealanders. A French
battleship dipped its flag as it passed, and our
boys sang "The Marseillaise."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Iron
Ration.</div>

<p>A mail that had come that day was being
sorted. While we waited, each man was served<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
with his "iron ration." This consisted of a one-pound
tin of pressed corned beef&mdash;the much-hated
and much-maligned "bully beef"&mdash;a bag
of biscuits, and a small tin that held two tubes
of Oxo, with tea and sugar in specially constructed
air- and damp-proof envelopes. This
was an emergency ration, to be kept in case of
direst need, and to be used only to ward off
actual starvation. After that we were given
our ammunition, two hundred and fifty rounds
to each man.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
solitary
letter
home.</div>

<p>But what brought home to me most the seriousness
of our venture was the solitary sheet
of letter paper, with its envelope, that was given
to every man to be used for a parting letter
home. For some poor chaps it was indeed the
last letter. Then we went over the side and
aboard the destroyer that was to take us to
Suvla Bay.</p>

<p>The night had been well chosen for a surprise
landing. There was no moon, but after a little
while the stars came out. Away on the port
bow we could see the dusky outline of land,
and once, when we were about half-way, an airship
soared phantomlike out of the night,
poised over us a short time, then ducked out
of sight. At first the word ran along the line
that it was a hostile airship, but a few inquiries
soon reassured us.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Approaching
Cape
Hellas.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Passing
Anzac.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The name
Anzac.</div>

<p>Suddenly we changed our direction. We were
near Cape Hellas, which is the lowest point of
the peninsula of Gallipoli. Under Sir Ian Hamilton's
scheme it was here that a decoy party
of French and British troops were to be landed
to draw the Turks from Anzac. Simultaneously
an overwhelming British force was to
land at Suvla Bay and Anzac to make a surprise
attack on the Turks' right flank. Presently
we were going upshore past the wrecked
steamer <i>River Clyde</i>, the famous "Ship of Troy"
from the side of which the Australians had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
issued after the ship had been beached on the
shore hitherto nameless, but now known as
Anzac. Australian New Zealand Army Corps
those five letters stand for; but to those of us
who have been on Gallipoli they stand for a
great deal more; they represent the achievement
of the impossible. They are a glorious
record of sacrifice, reckless devotion, and unselfish
courage; to put each letter there cost
the men from Australasia ten thousand of their
best soldiers.</p>

<p>And so we edged our way along, fearing
mines or, even more disastrous than mines,
discovery by the enemy. From the Australasians
over at Anzac we could hear desultory
rifle fire. Once we heard the boom of some big
guns that seemed almost alongside the ship.
Four hours it took us to go fifty miles in a
destroyer that could make thirty-two knots
easily. By one o'clock the stars had disappeared,
and for perhaps three-quarters of an
hour we nosed our way through pitch darkness.
Gradually we slowed down until we had almost
stopped. Something scraped along our side.
Somebody said it was a floating mine, but it
turned out to be a buoy that had been put there
by the navy to mark the channel.</p>

<p>Out of the gloom directly in front some one
hailed, and our people answered.</p>

<p>"Who have you on board?" we heard a casual
English voice say, and then came the reply from
our colonel:</p>

<p>"Newfoundlanders." There was to me something
very reassuring about that cool, self-contained
voice out of the night. It made me feel
that we were being expected and looked after.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Arrival
of a
launch.</div>

<p>"Move up those boats," I heard the English
voice say, and from right under our bow a
naval launch with a middy in charge swerved
alongside. In a little while it, with a string
of boats, was securely fastened.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>Just before we went into the boats the adjutant
passed me.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "you've got your wish. In
a few minutes you'll be ashore. Let me know
how you like it when you're there a little
while."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," I said. But I never had a chance
to tell him. The first shrapnel shell fired at
the Newfoundlanders burst near him, and he
had scarcely landed when he was taken off the
peninsula, seriously wounded.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Newfoundlanders
land.</div>

<p>In a short time we had all filed into the
boats. There was no noise, no excitement;
just now and then a whispered command. I
was in a tug with about twenty others who
formed the rear-guard. The wind had freshened
considerably, and was now blowing so
hard that our unwieldy tug dared not risk a
landing. We came in near enough to watch
the other boats. About twenty yards from
shore they grounded. We could see the boys
jump over the side and wade ashore. Through
the half-darkness we could barely distinguish
them forming up on the beach. Soon they were
lost to sight.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Enemy
artillery
in action.</div>

<p>During the Turkish summer dawn comes
early. We transhipped from our tug to a
lighter. When it grounded on the beach day
was just breaking. Daylight disclosed a steeply
sloping beach, scarred with ravines. The
place where we landed ran between sheer cliffs.
A short distance up the hill we could see our
battalion digging themselves in. To the left
I could see the boats of another battalion.
Even as I watched, the enemy's artillery located
them. It was the first shell I had ever heard.
It came over the hill close to me, screeching
through the air like an express-train going over
a bridge at night. Just above the boat I was
watching it exploded. A few of the soldiers
slipped quietly from their seats to the bottom<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
of the boat. At first I did not realize that any
one had been hit. There was no sign of anything
having happened out of the ordinary, no
confusion. As soon as the boat touched the
beach the wounded men were carried by their
mates up the hill to a temporary dressing-station.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Beginning
of bombardment.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Coolness
of the Newfoundlanders.</div>

<p>The first shell was the beginning of a bombardment.
Beachy Bill, a battery that we
were to become better acquainted with, was
in excellent shape. Every few minutes a shell
burst close to us. Shrapnel-bullets and fragments
of shell-casing forced us to huddle under
the baggage for protection. A little to the left
some Australians were severely punished. Shell
after shell burst among them. A regiment of
Sikh troops, mule-drivers, and transport-men
were caught half-way up the beach. Above
the din of falling shrapnel and the shriek of
flying shells rose the piercing scream of wounded
mules. The Newfoundlanders did not escape.
That morning Beachy Bill's gunners played
no favorites. On all sides the shrapnel came in
a shower. Less often, a cloud of thick, black
smoke and a hole twenty feet deep showed the
landing-place of a high-explosive shell. The
most amazing thing was the coolness of the
men. The Newfoundlanders might have been
practising trench-digging in camp in Scotland.
When a man was hit some one gave him first
aid, directed the stretcher-bearers where to
find him, and coolly resumed digging. In two
hours our position had become untenable. We
had been subjected to a merciless and devastating
shelling, and our first experience of war
had cost us sixty-five men. In a new and safer
position we dug ourselves in.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Four
miles of
graveyard.</div>

<p>No move could be made in daylight. That
evening we received our ration of rum, and
under cover of darkness moved in open order
across the Salt Lake for about a mile, then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
through three miles of knee-high, prickly underbrush,
to where our division was intrenched.
Our orders were to reinforce the Irish. The
Irish sadly needed reinforcing. Some of them
had been on the peninsula for months. Many
of them are still there. From the beach to the
firing-line is not over four miles, but it is a
ghastly four miles of graveyard. Everywhere
along the route are small, rude wooden crosses,
mute record of advances. Where the crosses
are thickest there the fighting was fiercest, and
where the fighting was fiercest there were the
Irish. On every cross, besides a man's name
and the date of his death, is the name of his
regiment. No other regiments have so many
crosses as the Dublins and the Munsters. And
where the shrapnel flew so fast that bodies
mangled beyond hope of identity were buried
in a common grave, there also are the Dublins
and Munsters; and the cross over them reads
"In Memory of Unknown Comrades."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
incomparable
Twenty-ninth.</div>

<div class="sidenote">How the
hill was
taken, and
lost.</div>

<p>The line on the left was held by the Twenty-ninth
Division; the Dublins, the Munsters, the
King's Own Scottish Borderers, and the Newfoundlanders
made up the 88th Brigade. The
Newfoundlanders were reinforcements. From
the very first days of the Gallipoli campaign
the other three regiments had formed part of
what General Sir Ian Hamilton in his report
calls the "incomparable Twenty-ninth Division."
When the first landing was made, this
division, with the New-Zealanders, penetrated
to the top of a hill that commanded the Narrows.
For forty-eight hours the result was in
doubt. The British attacked with bayonet and
bombs, were driven back, and repeatedly re-attacked.
The New-Zealanders finally succeeded
in reaching the top, followed by the
88th Brigade. The Irish fought on the tracks
of a railroad that leads into Constantinople.
At the end of forty-eight hours of attacks and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
counter-attacks the position was considered
secure. The worn-out soldiers were relieved
and went into dug-outs. Then the relieving
troops were attacked by an overwhelming hostile
force, and the hill was lost. A battery
placed on that hill could have shelled the Narrows
and opened to our ships the way to Constantinople.
The hill was never retaken. When
reinforcements came up it was too late. The
reinforcements lost their way. In his report
General Hamilton attributes our defeat to
"fatal inertia." Just how fatal was that
inertia is known only to those who formed some
of the burial-parties.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Newfoundlanders
run in
battle.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The Turks
charge in
mass formation.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Terrible
casualties
of the
enemy.</div>

<p>After the first forty-eight hours we settled
down to regular trench warfare. The routine
was four days in the trenches, eight days in
rest dug-outs, four in the trenches again, and
so forth, although two or three months later
our ranks were so depleted that we stayed in
eight days and rested only four. We had expected
four days' rest after our first trip to the
firing-line, but at the end of two days came
word of a determined advance of the enemy.
We arrived just in time to beat it off. Our
trenches, instead of being at the top, were at
the foot of the hill that meant so much to us.
The ground here was a series of four or five
hogback ridges about a hundred yards apart.
Behind these towered the hill that was our
objective. From the nearest ridge, about seven
hundred yards in front of us, the Turks had
all that day constantly issued in mass formation.
During that attack we were repaid for
the havoc wrought by Beachy Bill. As soon
as the Turk topped the crest they were subjected
to a demoralizing rain of shell from
the navy and the artillery. Against the hazy
blue of the sky-line we could see the dark mass
clearly silhouetted. Every few seconds, when
a shell landed in the middle of the approaching<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
columns, the sides of the column would
bulge outward for an instant, then close in
again. Meanwhile every man in our trenches
stood on the firing-platform, head and shoulders
above the parapet, with fixed bayonet and
loaded rifle, waiting for the order to begin firing.
Still the Turks came on, big, black, bewhiskered
six-footers, reforming ranks and
filling up their gaps with fresh men. Now
they were only six hundred yards away, but
still there was no order to open fire. It was
uncanny. At five hundred yards our fire was
still withheld. When the order came, "At four
hundred yards, rapid fire," everybody was
tingling with excitement. Still the Turks
came on, magnificently determined. But it
was too desperate a venture. The chances
against them were too great, our artillery and
machine-gun fire too destructively accurate.
Some few Turks reached almost to our trenches,
only to be stopped by rifle-bullets. "Allah!
Allah!" yelled the Turks as they came on. A
sweating, grimly happy machine-gun sergeant
between orders was shouting to the Turkish
army in general, "'Tis not a damn' bit of
good to yell to Allah now." Our artillery
opened huge gaps in their lines; our machine-guns
piled them dead in the ranks where they
stood. Our own casualties were very slight,
but of the waves of Turks that surged over
the crest all that day only a mere shattered
remnant ever straggled back to their own lines.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
armies in
a state of
siege.</div>

<p>That was the last big attack the Turks made.
From that time on it was virtually two armies
in a state of siege. Every night at dark we
stood to arms for an hour. Every man fixed
his bayonet and prepared to repulse any attack
of the enemy. After that sentry groups
were formed, three reliefs of two men each.
Two men stood with their heads over the parapet
watching for any movement in the no-man's-land<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
between the lines. That accounts
for the surprisingly large number of men one
sees wounded in the head.</p>

<p>At daylight every morning came "Stand to
arms" again. Then day duties began. In the
daytime, by using a periscope, an arrangement
of double mirrors, a sentry can keep his head
below the parapet while he watches the ground
in front. Sometimes a bullet struck one of
the mirrors, and the splintered glass blinded
the sentry. It was a common thing to see a
man go to hospital with his face badly lacerated
by periscope glass.</p>

<div class="sidenote">When a
shell
comes.</div>

<p>Ordinarily a man is much safer on the firing-line
than in the rest dug-outs. Trenches are
so constructed that even if a shell drops right
in the traverse where men are, only half a
dozen or so suffer. In open or slightly protected
ground where the dug-outs are the burst
of a shrapnel-shell covers an area twenty-five
by two hundred yards in extent.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Shrapnel
and
bullets.</div>

<p>A shell can be heard coming. Experts claim
to identify the caliber of a gun by the sound
the shell makes. Few live long enough to become
such experts. In Gallipoli the average
length of life was three weeks. In dug-outs
we always ate our meals, such as they were,
to the accompaniment of "Turkish Delight,"
the Newfoundlanders' name for shrapnel. We
had become accustomed to rifle-bullets. When
you hear the <i>zing</i> of a spent bullet or the sharp
crack of an explosive you know it has passed
you. The one that hits you you never hear.
At first we dodged at the sound of a passing
bullet, but soon we came actually to believe the
superstition that a bullet would not hit a man
unless it had on it his regimental number and
his name. Then, too, a bullet leaves a clean
wound, and a man hit by it drops out quietly.
The shrapnel makes nasty, jagged, hideous
wounds, the horrible recollection of which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
lingers for days. It is little wonder that we
preferred the firing-line.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The mode
of intrenching.</div>

<p>Most of our work was done at night. When
we wished to advance our line, we sent forward
a platoon of men the desired distance. Every
man carried with him three empty sand-bags
and his intrenching-tool. Temporary protection
is secured at short notice by having every
man dig a hole in the ground that is large and
deep enough to allow him to lie flat in it. The
intrenching-tool is a miniature pickax, one end
of which resembles a large-bladed hoe with a
sharpened and tempered edge. The pick end
is used to loosen hard material and to break up
large lumps; the other end is used as a shovel
to throw up the dirt. When used in this
fashion the wooden handle is laid aside, the
pick end becomes a handle, and the intrenching-tool
is used in the same manner as a trowel.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
necessity
for concealment.</div>

<p>Lying on our stomach, our rifles close at
hand, we dug furiously. First we loosened up
enough earth in front of our heads to fill a
sand-bag. This sand-bag we placed beside our
heads on the side nearest the enemy. Out in
no-man's-land, with bullets and machine-gun
balls pattering about us, we did fast work. As
soon as we had filled the second and third
sand-bags we placed them on top of the first.
In Gallipoli every other military necessity was
subordinated to concealment. Often we could
complete a trench and occupy it before the
enemy knew of it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Turks
use star-shells.</div>

<p>Sometimes while we were digging the Turks
surprised us by sending up star-shells. They
burst like rockets high overhead. Everything
was outlined in a strange, uncanny way that
gave the effect of stage-fire. At first when a
man saw a star-shell he dropped flat on his
face; but after a good many men had been
riddled by bullets, we saw our mistake. The
sudden blinding glare makes it impossible to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
identify objects before the light fades. Star-shells
show only movement. The first stir between
the lines becomes the target for both
sides. So after that, even when a man was
standing upright, he simply stood still.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Aeroplanes'">A&euml;roplanes</ins>
attacked
by artillery.</div>

<p>Every afternoon from just behind our lines
an a&euml;roplane buzzed up. At the tremendous
height it looked like an immense blue-bottle
fly. At first the enemy's a&euml;roplanes came out
to meet ours, but a few encounters with our
men soon convinced them of the futility of this.
After that they relied on their artillery. In
the air all around the tiny speck we could see
white puffs of smoke where their shrapnel was
exploding. Sometimes those puffs were perilously
close to it; at such times our hearts were
in our mouths. Everybody in the trench
craned his neck to see. When our a&euml;roplane
man&#339;uvered clear you could hear a sigh of
relief run along the trench.</p>

<div class="sidenote">An air-man's
adventure.</div>

<p>One of our air-men, Samson, captured a German
Taube that he used for daily reconnaissance.
Every day we watched him hover over
the Turkish lines, circle clear of their bursting
shrapnel, and return to our artillery with his
report. One day we watched two hostile planes
chase him back right to our trench. When
they came near us we opened rapid fire that
forced them to turn; but before Samson reached
his landing-place at Salt Lake we could see
that he was in trouble; one of the wings of the
machine was drooping badly. We watched
him land in safety, saw him jump out of his
seat, and walk about ten yards to a waiting
motor-ambulance. The ambulance had just
turned when a shell hit the a&euml;roplane. A
second shell blew it to pieces.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A naval
and
artillery
bombardment.</div>

<p>But Samson had completed his mission.
About half an hour later the navy in the bay
and our artillery began a bombardment. From
our trenches, looking through ravines, we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
could see the men-of-war lined up pouring
broadsides over our heads into the Turkish
lines. From our position in the valley we
watched our shells demolish the enemy's front-line
trenches on the hill well to our left.
Through field-glasses we could see the communication-trenches
choked with fleeing Turks.
Some of our artillery concentrated on the support-trenches,
preventing reinforcements from
coming up. A mule-train of supplies was
caught in the curtain of fire. The Turks,
caught between two fires, could not escape. In
a few minutes all that was left of the scientifically
constructed intrenchments was a conglomerate
heap of sand-bags, equipments, and
machine-guns; and on top of it all lay the
mangled bodies of men and mules.</p>

<p>All through the bombardment we had hoped
for the order to go over the parapet, but for
the Worcesters on our left was reserved the
distinction of making the charge. High explosives
cleared the way for their advance, and
cheering and yelling they went over the parapet.
The Turks in the front-line trenches, completely
demoralized, fled to the rear. A few,
too weak or too sorely wounded to run, surrendered.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Turk's
dislike for
German
officers.</div>

<p>Prisoners taken in this engagement told us
that the Turkish rank and file heartily hated
their German officers. One prisoner said that
he had been an officer, but since the outbreak of
this war had been replaced by a German. At
present the Turks are officered entirely by
Germans.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Losses
from
disease.</div>

<p>With the monotony varied occasionally by
some local engagement like this we dragged
through the hot, fly-pestered days and cold,
drafty, vermin-infested nights of September
and early October. By the middle of October,
1915, disease and scarcity of water had depleted
our ranks; instead of having four days<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
on the firing-line and eight days' rest, we were
holding the firing-line eight days and resting
only four. In my platoon, of the six non-commissioned
officers who started with us, only
two corporals were left, I and one other. For
a week after he had been ordered by the doctor
to leave the peninsula the other chap hung on,
pluckily determined not to leave me alone, although
staying meant keeping awake nearly
all night. By this time dysentery and enteric
had taken toll of more men than bullets. These
diseases became epidemic until the clearing-stations
and the beaches were choked with
sick. The time we should have been sleeping
was spent in digging, but still the men worked
uncomplainingly. Some, too game to quit,
would not report to the doctor, working on
courageously until they dropped, although
down in the bay beckoned the Red Cross of
the hospital-ship, with its assurance of safety,
rest, and cleanliness. By sickness and snipers'
bullets we lost thirty men a day. Every day
the sun poured down relentlessly, adding to
the torment of parched throats and tongues.
Every night, doubly cold in comparison with
the day's burning heat, found us chilled and
shivering.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
wounded
considered
lucky.</div>

<p>Nobody in the front-line trenches or on the
shell-swept area behind ever expected to leave
the peninsula alive. Their one hope was to
get off wounded. Every night men leaving the
trenches to bring up rations from the beach
shook hands with their comrades. From every
ration party of twenty men we always counted
on losing two. Those who were wounded were
looked on as lucky. The best thing we could
wish a man was a "cushy wound," one that
would not prove fatal. But no one wanted to
quit. Every day rumors flew through the
trenches that in four days all the Turks would
surrender. Men dying from dysentery and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
enteric lingered to see it, but the surrender
never materialized.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Faith in
Australians.</div>

<p>We knew that in the particular section of
trench held by us an advance was hopeless.
Still, we thought that some other parts of the
line might advance. There was always faith
in the invincible Australasians. Early in October,
1915, had come the news of the British
advance at Loos. The report that reached us
said that the enemy on the entire Western
front had begun to retreat. The Australians,
catching the Turks napping, took two lines
of trenches.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The man
who stood
on a
bomb.</div>

<p>By the time I left, the sordid monotony had
begun to tell on the men. Every day officers
were besieged with requests for permission to
go out between the lines to locate snipers.
When men were wanted for night patrol every
one volunteered. Ration parties, which had
formerly been a dread, were now an eagerly
sought variation. Any change was welcome.
The thought of being killed had lost its fear.
Daily intercourse with death had robbed it of
its horror. One chap had his leg blown off
from standing on a bomb. Later, in hospital,
he told me that he felt satisfied. He had always
wondered what would happen if a man
stood on a bomb; now he knew. It illustrates
how the men hated the deadly sameness. Anything
was better than waiting in the trenches,
better than being killed without a chance to
struggle.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Donnelly's
post on
Caribou
Ridge.</div>

<p>The men our regiment lost, although they
gladly fought a hopeless fight, have not died
in vain; the foremost advance on the Suvla
Bay front, Donnelly's Post on Caribou Ridge,
was made by Newfoundlanders. It is called
Donnelly's Post because it is here that Lieutenant
Donnelly won his military cross. The
hitherto nameless ridge from which the Turkish
machine-guns poured their concentrated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
death into our trenches stands as a monument
to the initiative of the Newfoundlanders. It
is now Caribou Ridge as a recognition of the
men who wear the deer's-head badge.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Swept by
machine-guns.</div>

<p>From Caribou Ridge the Turks could enfilade
parts of our firing-line. For weeks they
had continued to pick off our men one by one.
You could almost tell when your turn was
coming. I know, because from Caribou Ridge
came the bullet that sent me off the peninsula.
The machine-guns on Caribou Ridge not only
swept parts of our trench, but commanded all
of the intervening ground. Several attempts
had been made to rush those guns. All had
failed, held up by the murderous machine-gun
fire. Under cover of darkness, Lieutenant
Donnelly, with only eight men, surprised the
Turks in the post that now bears his name.
The captured machine-gun he used to repulse
constantly launched bomb and rifle attacks.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How
Donnelly
surprised
the Turks.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Deeds of
great
heroism.</div>

<p>Just at dusk one evening Donnelly stole out
to Caribou Ridge and surprised the Turks.
All night the Turks strove to recover their lost
ground. Darkness was the Newfoundlanders'
ally. When reinforcements arrived, Donnelly's
eight men were reduced to two. Dawn showed
the havoc wrought by the gallant little group.
The ground in front of the post was a shambles
of piled-up Turkish corpses. But daylight
showed something more to the credit of the
Newfoundlanders than the mere taking <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'oof'">of</ins> the
ridge. It showed one of Donnelly's men, Jack
Hynes, who had crawled away from his companion
to a point about two hundred yards to
the left. From here he had all alone kept up
through the whole night a rapid fire on the
enemy's flank that duped them into believing
that we had men there in force. It showed
Hynes purposely falling back over exposed
ground to draw the enemy's attention from
Sergeant Greene, who was coolly making trip<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
after trip between the ridge and our lines,
carrying a wounded man in his arms every time
until all our wounded were in safety. Hynes
and Greene were each given a distinguished-conduct
medal. None was ever more nobly
earned.</p>

<p>One Saturday morning near the end of October,
1915, the brigade major passed through
our lines. Before we took over the trench the
occupants of the firing-line threw their refuse
over the parapet into the short underbrush.
Since coming in we had made a dump for it.
I was sent out with five men to remove the
rubbish from the underbrush to the dump, and
this despite the fact that a short distance to
our right we had just lost two men sent over
the parapet in broad daylight to pick up some
cans.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
writer is
wounded.</div>

<p>About nine in the morning we started. It
was about half-an-hour's work. There was no
cover for men standing. The small bushes hid
men lying or sitting. Every little while I gave
the men a rest, making them sit in the shelter
of the underbrush. We had almost finished
when the snipers somewhere on our left began
to bang at us. I ordered the men to cover, and
was just pointing out a likely place to young
Hynes when I felt a dull thud in the left
shoulder-blade and a sharp pain in my chest.
Then came a drowsy, languid feeling, and
I sank down first on my knees, then my head
dropped over on my chest, and down I went
like a Mohammedan saying his prayers. Connecting
the hit in the back with the pain in my
chest, I concluded that I was done for, and
can distinctly remember thinking quite calmly
that I was indeed fortunate to be conscious
long enough to tell them what to do about my
will and so forth. I tried to say, "I'm hit,"
and must have succeeded, because immediately
I heard my henchman Hynes yell with a frenzied<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
oath: "The corporal's struck! Can't you
see the corporal's struck?" and heard him
curse the Turk. Then I heard the others say,
"We must get him in out of this." After that
I was quite clear-headed, and when three or
four of the finest boys that ever stepped risked
their lives to come out over the parapet under
fire, I was able to tell them how to lift me, and
when the stretcher-bearers arrived to give me
first aid I was conscious enough to tell them
where to look for the wound. Also I became
angry at the crowd who gathered around to
watch the dressing and make remarks about the
amount of blood. I asked them if they thought
it was a nickel-show. This when I felt almost
certain I was dying. I don't remember even
feeling relieved when they told me the bullet
had not gone through my heart.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hospital

<p>That night I was put on board a hospital-ship,
and a few days later I was in hospital at
Alexandria.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The rear-guard
action.</div>

<p>The night the First Newfoundland Regiment
landed in Suvla Bay there were about eleven
hundred of us. In December, 1915, when the
British forces evacuated Gallipoli, to the remnant
of our regiment fell the honor of fighting
the rear-guard action. This is the highest
recognition a regiment can receive; for the duty
of the rear-guard in a retreat is to keep the
enemy from reaching the main body of troops,
even if this means annihilation for itself. At
Lemnos island the next day, when the roll was
called, of the eleven hundred men who landed
when I did, only one hundred and seventy-one
answered "Here."</p>

<p>The German armies, following the Great Retreat

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>GAS: SECOND BATTLE OF YPRES</h2>

<h3>COL. E. D. SWINTON</h3>


<div class="sidenote">Second
Battle of
Ypres.</div>

<p>Since the last summary there has been a
sudden development in the situation on our
front, and very heavy fighting has taken
place to the north and northeast of Ypres,
which can be said to have assumed the importance
of a second battle for that town. With
the aid of a method of warfare up to now never
employed by nations sufficiently civilized to
consider themselves bound by international
agreements solemnly ratified by themselves,
and favored by the atmospheric conditions, the
Germans have put into effect an attack which
they have evidently contemplated and prepared
for some time.</p>

<p>Before the battle began our line in this quarter
ran from the cross-roads at Broodseinde,
east of Zonnebeke on the Ypres-Moorslede Road
to the cross-roads half a mile north of St.
Julien, on the Ypres-Poelcapelle Road, roughly
following the crest of what is known as the
Grafenstafel Ridge. The French prolonged the
line west of the Ypres-Poelcapelle Road, whence
their trenches ran around the north of Langemarck
to Steenstraate on the Yperlee Canal.
The area covered by the initial attack is that
between the canal and the Ypres-Poelcapelle
Road, though it was afterward extended to
the west of the canal and to the east of the
road.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Germans
plan a
gas attack.</div>

<p>An effort on the part of the Germans in this
direction was not unexpected, since movements
of troops and transport behind their front line
had been detected for some days. Its peculiar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
and novel nature, however, was a surprise
which was largely responsible for the measure
of success achieved. Taking advantage of the
fact that at this season of the year the wind
not infrequently blows from the north, they
secretly brought up apparatus for emitting
asphyxiating vapor or gas, and distributed it
along the section of their front line opposite
that of our allies, west of Langemarck, which
faced almost due north. Their plan was to
make a sudden onslaught southwestward,
which, if successful, might enable them to gain
the crossings on the canal south of Bixschoote
and place them well behind the British left in
a position to threaten Ypres.</p>

<p>The attack was originally fixed for Tuesday,
the 20th, but since all chances of success depended
on the action of the asphyxiating vapor
it was postponed, the weather being unfavorable.
On Thursday, the 22d, the wind blew
steadily from the north, and that afternoon,
all being ready, the Germans put their plan
into execution. Since then events have moved
so rapidly and the situation has moved so frequently
that it is difficult to give a consecutive
and clear story of what happened, but the following
account represents as nearly as can be
the general course of events. The details of
the gas apparatus employed by them are given
separately, as also those of the asphyxiating
grenades, bombs, and shells of which they have
been throwing hundreds.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The first
gas battle
in war.</div>

<p>At some time between 4 and 5 p.m. the Germans
started operations by releasing gases with
the result that a cloud of poisonous vapor rolled
swiftly before the wind from their trenches toward
those of the French west of Langemarck,
held by a portion of the French Colonial Division.
Allowing sufficient time for the fumes to
take full effect on the troops facing them, the
Germans charged forward over the practically<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
unresisting enemy in their immediate front,
and, penetrating through the gap thus created,
pressed on silently and swiftly to the south and
west. By their sudden irruption they were
able to overrun and surprise a large proportion
of the French troops billeted behind the front
line in this area and to bring some of the French
guns as well as our own under a hot rifle fire
at close range.</p>

<p>The first intimation that all was not well to
the north was conveyed to our troops holding
the left of the British line between 5 and 6 p.m.
by the withdrawal of some of the French
Colonials and the sight of the wall of vapor
following them. Our flank being thus exposed
the troops were ordered to retire on St. Julien,
with their left parallel to but to the west of
the high road. The splendid resistance of
these troops, who saved the situation, has
already been mentioned by the Commander in
Chief.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Bombardment
by
shell and
gas projectiles.</div>

<p>Meanwhile, apparently waiting till their
infantry had penetrated well behind the Allies'
line, the Germans had opened a hot artillery
fire upon the various tactical points to the
north of Ypres, the bombardment being carried
out with ordinary high-explosive shell and
shrapnel of various calibres and also with
projectiles containing asphyxiating gas. About
this period our men in reserve near Ypres, seeing
the shells bursting, had gathered in groups,
discussing the situation and questioning some
scattered bodies of Turcos who had appeared;
suddenly a staff officer rode up shouting "Stand
to your arms," and in a few minutes the troops
had fallen in and were marching northward to
the scene of the fight.</p>

<p>Nothing more impressive can be imagined
than the sight of our men falling in quietly in
perfect order on their alarm posts amid the
scene of wild confusion caused by the panic-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>stricken
refugees who swarmed along the
roads.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Steadiness
of the
British.</div>

<p>In the meantime, to the north and northeast
of the town, a confused fight was taking place,
which gave proof not only of great gallantry
and steadiness on the part of the troops referred
to above, but of remarkable presence of
mind on the part of their leaders. Behind the
wall of vapor, which had swept across fields,
through woods, and over hedgerows, came the
German firing line, the men's mouths and
noses, it is stated, protected by pads soaked in
a solution of bicarbonate of soda. Closely following
them again came the supports. These
troops, hurrying forward with their formation
somewhat broken up by the obstacles encountered
in their path, looked like a huge mob bearing
down upon the town. A battery of 4.7-inch
guns a little beyond the left of our line was
surprised and overwhelmed by them in a
moment. Further to the rear and in a more
easterly direction were several field batteries,
and before they could come into action the
Germans were within a few hundred yards.
Not a gun, however, was lost.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The left
retires
slowly.</div>

<p>One battery, taken in flank, swung around,
fired on the enemy at point-blank range, and
checked the rush. Another opened fire with
the guns pointing in almost opposite directions,
the enemy being on three sides of them. It was
under the very heavy cannonade opened about
this time by the Germans, and threatened by
the advance of vastly superior numbers, that
our infantry on our left steadily, and without
any sign of confusion, slowly retired to St.
Julien, fighting every step.</p>

<div class="sidenote">British
reserves
arrive.</div>

<p>Help was not long in arriving, for some of
our reserves near Ypres had stood to arms as
soon as they were aware of the fact that the
French line had been forced, and the officers
on their own initiative, without waiting for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
orders, led them forward to meet the advancing
enemy, who, by this time, were barely
two miles from the town. These battalions
attacked the Germans with the bayonet, and
then ensued a m&ecirc;l&eacute;e, in which our men more
than held their own, both sides losing very
heavily.</p>

<p>One German battalion seems to have been
especially severely handled, the Colonel being
captured among several other prisoners. Other
reinforcements were thrown in as they came
up, and, when night fell, the fighting continued
by moonlight, our troops driving back
the enemy by repeated bayonet charges, in
the course of which our heavy guns were
recaptured.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Germans
cross
the canal.</div>

<p>By then the situation was somewhat restored
in the area immediately north of Ypres. Further
to the west, however, the enemy had forced
their way over the canal, occupying Steenstraate
and the crossing at Het Sast, about
three-quarters of a mile south of the former
place, and had established themselves at various
points on the west bank. All night long the
shelling continued, and about 1.30 a.m. two
heavy attacks were made on our line in the
neighborhood of Broodseinde, east of Zonnebeke.
These were both repulsed. The bombardment
of Ypres itself and its neighborhood
had by now redoubled in intensity and a part
of the town was in flames.</p>

<p>In the early morning of Friday, the 23d, we
delivered a strong counter-attack northward
in co-operation with the French. Our advance
progressed for some little distance, reaching
the edge of the wood about half a mile west of
St. Julien and penetrating it. Here our men
got into the Germans with the bayonet, and
the latter suffered heavily. The losses were
also severe on our side, for the advance had
to be carried out across the open. But in spite<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
of this nothing could exceed the dash with
which it was conducted. One man&mdash;and his
case is typical of the spirit shown by the troops&mdash;who
had had his rifle smashed by a bullet,
continued to fight with an intrenching tool.
Even many of the wounded made their way
out of the fight with some article of German
equipment as a memento.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
British
intrench.</div>

<p>About 11 a.m., not being able to progress
further, our troops dug themselves in, the line
then running from St. Julien practically due
west for about a mile, whence it curved southwestward
before turning north to the canal
near Boesinghe. Broadly speaking, on the section
of the front then occupied by us the result
of the operations had been to remove to
some extent the wedge which the Germans had
driven into the allied line, and the immediate
danger was over.</p>

<p>During the afternoon our counter-attack
made further progress south of Pilkem, thus
straightening the line still more. Along the
canal the fighting raged fiercely, our allies
making some progress here and there. During
the night, however, the Germans captured
Lizerne, a village on the main road from Ypres
to Steenstraate.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
enemy
throws
bridges
across the
canal.</div>

<p>When the morning of the 24th came the
situation remained much the same, but the
enemy, who had thrown several bridges across
the canal, continued to gain ground to the west.
On our front the Germans, under cover of their
gas, made a further attack between 3 and 4
a.m. to the east of St. Julien and forced back
a portion of our line. Nothing else in particular
occurred until about midday, when
large bodies of the enemy were seen advancing
down the Ypres-Poelcapelle road toward St.
Julien. Soon after a very strong attack developed
against that village and the section of
the line east of it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">A French
counter-attack.</div>

<p>Under the pressure of these fresh masses our
troops were compelled to fall back, contesting
every inch of ground and making repeated
counter-attacks; but until late at night a
gallant handful, some 200 to 300 strong, held
out in St. Julien. During the night the line
was re-established north of the hamlet of
Fortuin, about 700 yards further to the rear.
All this time the fighting along the canal continued,
the enemy forcing their way across near
Boesinghe, and holding Het Sase, Steenstraate,
and Lizerne strongly. The French counter-attacked
in the afternoon, captured fifty prisoners,
and made some further progress toward
Pilkem. The Germans, however, were still holding
the west bank firmly, although the Belgian
artillery had broken the bridge behind them at
Steenstraate.</p>

<div class="sidenote">German
assaults on
Broodseinde.</div>

<p>On the morning of Sunday, the fourth day
of the battle, we made a strong counter-attack
on St. Julien, which gained some ground but
was checked in front of the village. To the
west of it we reached a point a few hundred
yards south of the wood which had been the
objective on the 23d and which we had had to
relinquish subsequently. In the afternoon the
Germans made repeated assaults in great
strength on our line near Broodseinde. These
were backed up by a tremendous artillery bombardment
under the throwing of asphyxiating
bombs; but all were beaten off with great
slaughter to the enemy, and forty-five prisoners
fell into our hands. When night came the
situation remained unchanged.</p>

<p>This determined offensive on the part of the
enemy, although it has menaced Ypres itself,
has not so far the appearance of a great effort
to break the line and capture the Channel ports.
Its initial success was gained by the surprise
rendered possible by the use of a device which
Germany pledged herself not to employ.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<h2>THE CANADIANS AT YPRES</h2>

<h3>BY THE CANADIAN
RECORD OFFICER</h3>


<div class="sidenote">Position
of the
Canadian
Division.</div>

<p>On April 22 the Canadian Division held a
line of, roughly, 5,000 yards, extending
in a northwesterly direction from the
Ypres-Roulers Railway to the Ypres-Poelcapelle
road, and connecting at its terminus with the
French troops. The division consisted of three
infantry brigades, in addition to the artillery
brigades. Of the infantry brigades the First
was in reserve, the Second was on the right,
and the Third established contact with the
Allies at the point indicated above.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
sudden
gas
attack.</div>

<p>The day was a peaceful one, warm and sunny,
and except that the previous day had witnessed
a further bombardment of the stricken town of
Ypres, everything seemed quiet in front of the
Canadian line. At 5 o'clock in the afternoon
a plan, carefully prepared, was put into execution
against our French allies on the left.
Asphyxiating gas of great intensity was projected
into their trenches, probably by means of
force pumps and pipes laid out under the parapets.
The fumes, aided by a favorable wind,
floated backward, poisoning and disabling over
an extended area those who fell under their
effect.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
French
give
ground.</div>

<p>The result was that the French were compelled
to give ground for a considerable distance.
The glory which the French Army has
won in this war would make it impertinent to
labor the compelling nature of the poisonous
discharges under which the trenches were lost.
The French did, as every one knew they would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
do, all that stout soldiers could do, and the
Canadian Division, officers and men, look forward
to many occasions in the future in which
they will stand side by side with the brave
armies of France.</p>

<p>The immediate consequences of this enforced
withdrawal were, of course, extremely grave.
The Third Brigade of the Canadian Division
was without any left, or, in other words, its
left was in the air.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Gap
on the
Canadian
left.</div>

<p>It became imperatively necessary greatly to
extend the Canadian lines to the left rear. It
was not, of course, practicable to move the
First Brigade from reserve at a moment's
notice, and the line, extending from 5,000 to
9,000 yards, was naturally not the line that
had been held by the Allies at 5 o'clock, and
a gap still existed on its left.</p>

<p>It became necessary for Brigadier General
Turner, commanding the Third Brigade, to
throw back his left flank southward to protect
his rear.</p>

<p>In the course of the confusion which followed
upon the readjustments of position, the
enemy, who had advanced rapidly after his
initial successes, took four British 4.7 guns in
a small wood to the west of the village of St.
Julien, two miles in the rear of the original
French trenches.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Heroism
of the
Canadian
Division.</div>

<p>The story of the second battle of Ypres is
the story of how the Canadian Division, enormously
outnumbered&mdash;for they had in front of
them at least four divisions, supported by immensely
heavy artillery&mdash;with a gap still existing,
though reduced, in their lines, and with
dispositions made hurriedly under the stimulus
of critical danger, fought through the day and
through the night, and then through another
day and night; fought under their officers until,
as happened to so many, those perished gloriously,
and then fought from the impulsion of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
sheer valor because they came from fighting
stock.</p>

<p>The enemy, of course, was aware&mdash;whether
fully or not may perhaps be doubted&mdash;of the
advantage his breach in the line had given him,
and immediately began to push a formidable
series of attacks upon the whole of the newly-formed
Canadian salient. If it is possible to
distinguish when the attack was everywhere so
fierce, it developed with particular intensity at
this moment upon the apex of the newly formed
line, running in the direction of St. Julien.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Assault
on the
wood.</div>

<p>It has already been stated that four British
guns were taken in a wood comparatively early
in the evening of the 22d. In the course of that
night, and under the heaviest machine-gun fire,
this wood was assaulted by the Canadian Scottish,
Sixteenth Battalion of the Third Brigade,
and the Tenth Battalion of the Second Brigade,
which was intercepted for this purpose on its
way to a reserve trench. The battalions were
respectively commanded by Lieutenant Colonel
Leckie and Lieutenant Colonel Boyle, and after
a most fierce struggle in the light of a misty
moon they took the position at the point of the
bayonet. At midnight the Second Battalion,
under Colonel Watson, and the Toronto Regiment,
Queen's Own, Third Battalion, under
Lieutenant Colonel Rennie, both of the First
Brigade, brought up much-needed reinforcement,
and though not actually engaged in the
assault were in reserve.</p>

<p>All through the following days and nights
these battalions shared the fortunes and misfortunes
of the Third Brigade. An officer who
took part in the attack describes how the men
about him fell under the fire of the machine
guns, which, in his phrase, played upon them
"like a watering pot." He added quite simply,
"I wrote my own life off." But the line never
wavered. When one man fell another took his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
place, and with a final shout the survivors of
the two battalions flung themselves into the
wood. The German garrison was completely
demoralized, and the impetuous advance of the
Canadians did not cease until they reached the
far side of the wood and intrenched themselves
there in the position so dearly gained. They
had, however, the disappointment of finding
that the guns had been <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'blow'">blown</ins> up by the enemy,
and later on in the same night a most formidable
concentration of artillery fire, sweeping
the wood as a tropical storm sweeps the leaves
from a forest, made it impossible for them to
hold the position for which they had sacrificed
so much.</p>

<p>The fighting continued without intermission
all through the night, and, to those who observed
the indications that the attack was being
pushed with ever-growing strength, it hardly
seemed possible that the Canadians, fighting
in positions so difficult to defend and so
little the subject of deliberate choice, could
maintain their resistance for any long period.
At 6 A. M. on Friday it became apparent that
the left was becoming more and more involved,
and a powerful German attempt to outflank
it developed rapidly. The consequences, if it
had been broken or outflanked, need not be insisted
upon. They were not merely local.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Counter-attack
on
German lines.</div>

<p>It was therefore decided, formidable as the
attempt undoubtedly was, to try and give relief
by a counter-attack upon the first line of
German trenches, now far, far advanced from
those originally occupied by the French. This
was carried out by the Ontario First and
Fourth Battalions of the First Brigade, under
Brigadier General Mercer, acting in combination
with a British brigade.</p>

<p>It is safe to say that the youngest private
in the rank, as he set his teeth for the advance,
knew the task in front of him, and the youngest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
subaltern knew all that rested upon its
success. It did not seem that any human being
could live in the shower of shot and shell
which began to play upon the advancing troops.
They suffered terrible casualties. For a short
time every other man seemed to fall, but the
attack was pressed ever closer and closer.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Enemy's
first line
trenches
taken.</div>

<p>The Fourth Canadian Battalion at one
moment came under a particularly withering
fire. For a moment&mdash;not more&mdash;it wavered.
Its most gallant commanding officer, Lieutenant
Colonel Burchill, carrying, after an old
fashion, a light cane, coolly and cheerfully
rallied his men and, at the very moment when
his example had infected them, fell dead at the
head of his battalion. With a hoarse cry of
anger they sprang forward, (for, indeed, they
loved him,) as if to avenge his death. The
astonishing attack which followed&mdash;pushed
home in the face of direct frontal fire made
in broad daylight by battalions whose names
should live for ever in the memories of soldiers&mdash;was
carried to the first line of German
trenches. After a hand-to-hand struggle the
last German who resisted was bayoneted, and
the trench was won.</p>

<p>The measure of this success may be taken
when it is pointed out that this trench represented
in the German advance the apex in
the breach which the enemy had made in the
original line of the Allies, and that it was two
and a half miles south of that line. This
charge, made by men who looked death indifferently
in the face, (for no man who took part
in it could think that he was likely to live,)
saved, and that was much, the Canadian left.
But it did more. Up to the point where the assailants
conquered, or died, it secured and
maintained during the most critical moment
of all the integrity of the allied line. For the
trench was not only taken, it was held thereafter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
against all comers, and in the teeth of
every conceivable projectile, until the night of
Sunday, the 25th, when all that remained of
the war-broken but victorious battalions was
relieved by fresh troops.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
poisonous
gas
attack.</div>

<p>It is necessary now to return to the fortunes
of the Third Brigade, commanded by Brigadier
General Turner, which, as we have seen, at 5
o'clock on Thursday was holding the Canadian
left, and after the first attack assumed the defense
of the new Canadian salient, at the same
time sparing all the men it could to form an extemporized
line between the wood and St.
Julien. This brigade also was at the first moment
of the German offensive, made the object
of an attack by the discharge of poisonous gas.
The discharge was followed by two enemy
assaults. Although the fumes were extremely
poisonous, they were not, perhaps having regard
to the wind, so disabling as on the French
lines, (which ran almost east to west,) and the
brigade, though affected by the fumes, stoutly
beat back the two German assaults.</p>

<p>Encouraged by this success, it rose to the
supreme effort required by the assault on the
wood, which has already been described. At
4 o'clock on the morning of Friday, the 23d,
a fresh emission of gas was made both upon
the Second Brigade, which held the line running
northeast, and upon the Third Brigade,
which, as has been fully explained, had continued
the line up to the pivotal point, as defined
above, and had then spread down in a
southeasterly direction. It is, perhaps, worth
mentioning that two privates of the Forty-eighth
Highlanders who found their way into
the trenches commanded by Colonel Lipsett,
Ninetieth Winnipeg Rifles, Eighth Battalion,
perished in the fumes, and it was noticed that
their faces became blue immediately after dissolution.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">A brief
retirement.</div>

<p>The Royal Highlanders of Montreal, Thirteenth
Battalion, and the Forty-eighth Highlanders,
Fifteenth Battalion, were more especially
affected by the discharge. The Royal
Highlanders, though considerably shaken, remained
immovable upon their ground. The
Forty-eighth Highlanders, which, no doubt, received
a more poisonous discharge, was for the
moment dismayed, and, indeed, their trench,
according to the testimony of very hardened
soldiers, became intolerable. The battalion retired
from the trench, but for a very short distance,
and for an equally short time, in a few
moments they were again their own men. They
advanced upon and occupied the trenches
which they had momentarily abandoned.</p>

<p>In the course of the same night the Third
Brigade, which had already displayed a resource,
a gallantry, and a tenacity for which
no eulogy could be excessive, was exposed
(and with it the whole allied case) to a peril
still more formidable.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Germans
pass gap
on left.</div>

<p>It has been explained, and, indeed, the fundamental
situation made the peril clear, that
several German divisions were attempting to
crush or drive back this devoted brigade, and
in any event to use their enormous numerical
superiority to sweep around and overwhelm
its left wing. At some point in the line which
cannot be precisely determined the last attempt
partially succeeded, and in the course
of this critical struggle German troops in considerable
though not in overwhelming numbers
swung past the unsupported left of the
brigade, and, slipping in between the wood
and St. Julien, added to the torturing anxieties
of the long-drawn struggle by the appearance,
and indeed for the moment the reality,
of isolation from the brigade base.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Royal
Highlanders of
Montreal.</div>

<p>In the exertions made by the Third Brigade
during this supreme crisis it is almost impossible<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
to single out one battalion without injustice
to others, but though the efforts of the
Royal Highlanders of Montreal, Thirteenth
Battalion, were only equal to those of the other
battalions who did such heroic service, it so
happened by chance that the fate of some of
its officers attracted special attention.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Death of
Captain
McCuaig.</div>

<p>Major Norsworth, already almost disabled
by a bullet wound, was bayoneted and killed
while he was rallying his men with easy cheerfulness.
The case of Captain McCuaig, of the
same battalion, was not less glorious, although
his death can claim no witness. This most
gallant officer was seriously wounded, in a
hurriedly constructed trench, at a moment
when it would have been possible to remove
him to safety. He absolutely refused to move
and continued in the discharge of his duty.</p>

<p>But the situation grew constantly worse,
and peremptory orders were received for an
immediate withdrawal. Those who were compelled
to obey them were most insistent to
carry with them, at whatever risk to their
own mobility and safety, an officer to whom
they were devotedly attached. But he, knowing,
it may be, better than they, the exertions
which still lay in front of them, and unwilling
to inflict upon them the disabilities of a
maimed man, very resolutely refused, and
asked of them one thing only, that there should
be given to him, as he lay alone in the trench,
two loaded Colt revolvers to add to his own,
which lay in his right hand as he made his
last request. And so, with three revolvers
ready to his hand for use, a very brave officer
waited to sell his life, wounded and racked
with pain, in an abandoned trench.</p>

<p>On Friday afternoon the left of the Canadian
line was strengthened by important reinforcements
of British troops amounting to
seven battalions. From this time forward the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
Canadians also continued to receive further
assistance on the left from a series of French
counter-attacks pushed in a northeasterly
direction from the canal bank.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
defenders
give
ground.</div>

<p>But the artillery fire of the enemy continually
grew in intensity, and it became more and
more evident that the Canadian salient could
no longer be maintained against the overwhelming
superiority of numbers by which it
was assailed. Slowly, stubbornly, and contesting
every yard, the defenders gave ground until
the salient gradually receded from the apex,
near the point where it had originally aligned
with the French, and fell back upon St. Julien.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
enemy in
St. Julien.</div>

<p>Soon it became evident that even St. Julien,
exposed to fire from right and left, was no
longer tenable in the fact of overwhelming
numerical superiority. The Third Brigade was
therefore ordered to retreat further south, selling
every yard of ground as dearly as it had
done since 5 o'clock on Thursday. But it was
found impossible, without hazarding far larger
forces, to disentangle the detachment of the
Royal Highlanders of Montreal, Thirteenth
Battalion, and of the Royal Montreal Regiment,
Fourteenth Battalion. The brigade was
ordered, and not a moment too soon, to move
back. It left these units with hearts as heavy
as those with which his comrades had said farewell
to Captain McCuaig. The German tide
rolled, indeed, over the deserted village, but
for several hours after the enemy had become
master of the village the sullen and persistent
rifle fire which survived showed that they were
not yet master of the Canadian rearguard. If
they died, they died worthily of Canada.</p>

<p>The enforced retirement of the Third Brigade
(and to have stayed longer would have
been madness) reproduced for the Second Brigade,
commanded by Brigadier General Curry,
in a singularly exact fashion, the position of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
the Third Brigade itself at the moment of the
withdrawal of the French. The Second Brigade,
it must be remembered, had retained the
whole line of trenches, roughly 2,500 yards,
which it was holding at 5 o'clock on Thursday
afternoon, supported by the incomparable exertions
of the Third Brigade, and by the highly
hazardous employment in which necessity had
involved that brigade. The Second Brigade
had maintained its lines.</p>

<div class="sidenote">General
Curry's
maneuvres.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Lieutenant
Colonel Lipsett

<p>It now devolved upon General Curry, commanding
this brigade, to reproduce the tactical
maneuvres with which, earlier in the fight, the
Third Brigade had adapted itself to the flank
movement of overwhelming numerical superiority.
He flung his left flank around south,
and his record is, that in the very crisis of this
immense struggle he held his line of trenches
from Thursday at 5 o'clock till Sunday afternoon.
And on Sunday afternoon he had not
abandoned his trenches. There were none left.
They had been obliterated by artillery. He
withdrew his undefeated troops from the fragments
of his field fortifications, and the hearts
of his men were as completely unbroken as
the parapets of his trenches were completely
broken. In such a brigade it is invidious to
single out any battalion for special praise, but
it is, perhaps, necessary to the story to point
out that Lieutenant Colonel Lipsett, commanding
the Ninetieth Winnipeg Rifles, Eighth
Battalion of the Second Brigade, held the extreme
left of the brigade position at the most
critical moment.</p>

<p>The battalion was expelled from the trenches
early on Friday morning by an emission of
poisonous gas, but, recovering in three-quarters
of an hour, it counter-attacked, retook the
trenches it had abandoned, and bayoneted the
enemy. And after the Third Brigade had been
forced to retire Lieutenant Colonel Lipsett held<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
his position, though his left was in the air,
until two British regiments filled up the gap on
Saturday night.</p>

<p>The individual fortunes of these two brigades
have brought us to the events of Sunday
afternoon, but it is necessary, to make the
story complete, to recur for a moment to the
events of the morning. After a very formidable
attack the enemy succeeded in capturing
the village of St. Julien, which has so often
been referred to in describing the fortunes of
the Canadian left. This success opened up a
new and formidable line of advance, but by
this time further reinforcements had arrived.
Here, again, it became evident that the tactical
necessities of the situation dictated an offensive
movement as the surest method of arresting
further progress.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cheers
for the
Canadians.</div>

<p>General Alderson, who was in command of
the reinforcements, accordingly directed that
an advance should be made by a British brigade
which had been brought up in support.
The attack was thrust through the Canadian
left and centre, and as the troops making it
swept on, many of them going to certain death,
they paused an instant, and, with deep-throated
cheers for Canada, gave the first indication
to the division of the warm admiration
which their exertions had excited in the
British Army.</p>

<p>The advance was indeed costly, but it could
not be gainsaid. The story is one of which the
brigade may be proud, but it does not belong
to the special account of the fortunes of the
Canadian contingent. It is sufficient for our
purpose to notice that the attack succeeded in
its object, and the German advance along the
line, momentarily threatened, was arrested.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Second
and Third
Brigades
relieved.</div>

<p>We had reached, in describing the events of
the afternoon, the points at which the trenches
of the Second Brigade had been completely destroyed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
This brigade, the Third Brigade, and
the considerable reinforcements which this
time filled the gap between the two brigades
were gradually driven fighting every yard
upon a line running, roughly, from Fortuin,
south of St. Julien, in a northeasterly direction
toward Passchendaele. Here the two brigades
were relieved by two British brigades, after
exertions as glorious, as fruitful, and, alas! as
costly as soldiers have ever been called upon
to make.</p>

<p>Monday morning broke bright and clear and
found the Canadians behind the firing line.
This day, too, was to bring its anxieties. The
attack was still pressed, and it became necessary
to ask Brigadier General Curry whether
he could once more call upon his shrunken brigade.
"The men are tired," this indomitable
soldier replied, "but they are ready and glad to
go again to the trenches." And so once more, a
hero leading heroes, the General marched back
the men of the Second Brigade, reduced to a
quarter of its original strength, to the very
apex of the line as it existed at that moment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Back
to the
apex of
the line.</div>

<p>This position he held all day Monday; on
Tuesday he was still occupying the reserve
trenches, and on Wednesday was relieved and
retired to billets in the rear.</p>

<p>Such, in the most general outline, is the
story of a great and glorious feat of arms. A
story told so soon after the event, while rendering
bare justice to units whose doings fell
under the eyes of particular observers, must do
less than justice to others who played their
part&mdash;and all did&mdash;as gloriously as those
whose special activities it is possible, even at
this stage, to describe. But the friends of men
who fought in other battalions may be content
in the knowledge that they, too, shall
learn, when time allows the complete correlation
of diaries, the exact part which each unit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
played in these unforgettable days. It is rather
accident than special distinction which had
made it possible to select individual battalions
for mention.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Signalers
and dispatch
carriers.</div>

<p>It would not be right to close even this account
without a word of tribute to the auxiliary
services. The signalers were always cool
and resourceful. The telegraph and telephone
wires being constantly cut, many belonging to
this service rendered up their lives in the discharge
of their duty, carrying out repairs with
the most complete calmness in exposed positions.
The dispatch carriers, as usual, behaved
with the greatest bravery. Theirs is a lonely
life, and very often a lonely death. One cycle
messenger lay upon the ground, badly
wounded. He stopped a passing officer and delivered
his message, together with some verbal
instructions. These were coherently given, but
he swooned almost before the words were out
of his mouth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Artillery
and engineers.</div>

<p>The artillery never flagged in the sleepless
struggle in which so much depended upon its
exertions. Not a Canadian gun was lost in
the long battle of retreat. And the nature of
the position renders such a record very remarkable.
One battery of four guns found itself
in such a situation that it was compelled
to turn two of its guns directly about and fire
upon the enemy in positions almost diametrically
opposite.</p>

<p>It is not possible in this account to attempt
a description of the services rendered by the
Canadian Engineers or the Medical Corps.
Their members rivaled in coolness, endurance,
and valor the Canadian infantry, whose comrades
they were, and it is hoped in separate
communications to do justice to both these
brilliant services.</p>

<p>No attempt has been made in this description
to explain the recent operations except in so far<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
as they spring from, or are connected with,
the fortunes of the Canadian Division. It is
certain that the exertions of the troops who
reinforced and later relieved the Canadians
were not less glorious, but the long, drawn-out
struggle is a lesson to the whole empire. "Arise,
O Israel!" The empire is engaged in a struggle,
without quarter and without compromise,
against an enemy still superbly organized, still
immensely powerful, still confident that its
strength is the mate of its necessities. To
arms, then, and still to arms! In Great Britain,
in Canada, in Australia there is need, and
there is need now, of a community organized
alike in military and industrial co-operation.</p>

<p>That our countrymen in Canada, even while
their hearts are still bleeding, will answer
every call which is made upon them, we well
know.</p>

<p>Assaults accompanied with gas were not
made on every position of the front held by the
British to the north of Ypres at the same time.
At one point it was not until the early morning
of Saturday, April 24, that the Germans
brought this method into operation against a
section of our line not far from our left flank.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Germans
fire poison
gas shells.</div>

<p>Late on Thursday afternoon the men here
saw portions of the French retiring some distance
to the west, and observed the cloud of
vapor rolling along the ground southward behind
them. Our position was then shelled with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
high explosives until 8 P.M. On Friday also
it was bombarded for some hours, the Germans
firing poison shells for one hour. Their infantry,
who were intrenched about 120 yards
away, evidently expected some result from their
use of the latter, for they put their heads above
the parapets, as if to see what the effect had
been on our men, and at intervals opened rapid
rifle fire. The wind, however, was strong and
dissipated the fumes quickly, our troops did
not suffer seriously from their noxious effect,
and the enemy did not attempt any advance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Stupefying
gas
employed.</div>

<p>On Saturday morning, just about dawn, an
airship appeared in the sky to the east of our
line at this point, and dropped four red stars,
which floated downward slowly for some distance
before they died out. When our men,
whose eyes had not unnaturally been fixed on
this display of pyrotechnics, again turned to
their front it was to find the German trenches
rendered invisible by a wall of greenish-yellow
vapor, similar to that observed on the Thursday
afternoon, which was bearing down on
them on the breeze. Through this the Germans
started shooting. During Saturday they employed
stupefying gas on several occasions in
this quarter, but did not press on very quickly.
One reason for this, given by a German
prisoner, is that many of the enemy's infantry
were so affected by the fumes that they could
not advance.</p>

<p>To continue the narrative from the night of
Sunday, April 25. At 12:30 A. M., in face of
repeated attacks, our infantry fell back from
a part of the Grafenstafel Ridge, northwest of
Zonnebeke, and the line then ran for some distance
along the south bank of the little Haanebeek
stream. The situation along the Yperlee
Canal remained practically unchanged.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Line
pierced at
Broodseinde.</div>

<p>When the morning of the 26th dawned the
Germans, who had been seen massing in St.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
Julien, and to the east of the village on the
previous evening, made several assaults, which
grew more and more fierce as the hours passed,
but reinforcements were sent up and the position
was secured. Further east, however, our
line was pierced near Broodseinde, and a small
body of the enemy established themselves in a
portion of our trenches. In the afternoon a
strong, combined counter-attack was delivered
by the French and British along the whole
front from Steenstraate to the east of St.
Julien, accompanied by a violent bombardment.
This moment, so far as can be judged
at present, marked the turning point of the
battle, for, although it effected no great change
in the situation, it caused a definite check to
the enemy's offensive, relieved the pressure, and
gained a certain amount of ground.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Attack
near St.
Julien.</div>

<p>During this counter-attack the guns concentrated
by both sides on this comparatively
narrow front poured in a great volume of fire.
From the right came the roar of the British
batteries, from the left the rolling thunder of
the <i>soixante-quinze</i>, and every now and then
above the turmoil rose a dull boom as a huge
howitzer shell burst in the vicinity of Ypres.
On the right our infantry stormed the German
trenches close to St. Julien, and in the evening
gained the southern outskirts of the village.
In the centre they captured the trenches a
little to the south of the Bois des Cuisinirs,
west of St. Julien, and still further west more
trenches were taken. This represented an advance
of some 600 or 700 yards, but the gain
in ground could not at all points be maintained.
Opposite St. Julien we fell back from the
village to a position just south of the place,
and in front of the Bois des Cuisinirs and on
the left of the line a similar retirement took
place, the enemy making extensive use of his
gas cylinders and of machine guns placed in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
farms or at other points of vantage. None the
less, the situation at nightfall was more satisfactory
than it had been. We were holding our
own well all along the line and had made progress
at some points. On the right the enemy's
attacks on the front of the Grafenstafel Ridge
had all been repulsed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Enemy
lines.</div>

<p>In the meantime the French had achieved
some success, having retaken Lizerne and also
the trenches round Het Sast, captured some
250 prisoners, and made progress all along the
west bank of the canal. Heavy as our losses
were during the day, there is little doubt that
the enemy suffered terribly. Both sides were
attacking at different points, the fighting was
conducted very largely in the open, and the
close formations of the Germans on several occasions
presented excellent targets to our artillery,
which did not fail to seize its opportunities.</p>

<p>Nothing in particular occurred during the
night.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The new
battle
lines.</div>

<p>The morning of the 27th found our troops
occupying the following positions; North of
Zonnebeke the right of the line still held the
eastern end of the Grafenstafel Ridge, but from
here it bent southwestward behind the Haanebeek
stream, which it followed to a point about
half a mile east of St. Julien. Thence it curved
back again to the Vamheule Farm, on the
Ypres-Poelcappelle road, running from here in
a slight southerly curve to a point a little west
of the Ypres-Langemarck road, where it joined
the French. In the last mentioned quarter of
the field it followed generally the line of a low
ridge running from west to east. On the
French front the Germans had been cleared
from the west bank of the canal, except at one
point, Steenstraate, where they continued to
hold the bridgehead.</p>

<p>About 1 P. M. a counter-attack was made by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
us all along the line between the canal and the
Ypres-Poelcappelle road, and for about an hour
we continued to make progress. Then the right
and centre were checked. A little later the left
was also held up, and the situation remained
very much as it had been on the previous day.
The Germans were doubtless much encouraged
by their initial success, and their previous boldness
in attack was now matched by the stubborn
manner in which they clung on to their
positions. In the evening the French stormed
some trenches east of the canal, but were again
checked by the enemy's gas cylinders.</p>

<div class="sidenote">German
exhaustion.</div>

<p>The night passed quietly, and was spent by
us in reorganizing and consolidating our positions.
The enemy did not interfere. This is
not surprising, in view of the fact that by
Tuesday evening they had been fighting for
over five days. Their state of exhaustion is confirmed
by the statements of the prisoners captured
by the French, who also reported that
the German losses had been very heavy.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, the 28th, there was a complete
lull on this sector of our line, and the
shelling was less severe. Some fighting, however,
occurred along the canal, the French
taking over 100 prisoners.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Air
battles.</div>

<p>Nothing of any importance has occurred on
other parts of the front. On the 27th at the
Railway Triangle opposite Guinchy, the south
side of the embankment held by the Germans
was blown up by our miners. On the 28th a
hostile aeroplane was forced to descend by our
anti-aircraft guns. On coming down in rear of
the German lines, it was at once fired upon and
destroyed by our field artillery. Another
hostile machine was brought down by rifle fire
near Zonnebeke.</p>

<p>Splendid work has been done during the past
few days by our airmen, who have kept all the
area behind the hostile lines under close observation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
On the 26th they bombed the stations
of Staden, Thielt, Courtrai, Roubaix, and
other places, and located an armored train near
Langemarck, which was subsequently shelled
and forced to retire. There have been several
successful conflicts in the air, on one occasion a
pilot in a single seater chasing a German machine
to Roulers, and forcing it to land.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Raid on
Courtrai</div>

<p>The raid on Courtrai unfortunately cost the
nation a very gallant life, but it will live as one
of the most heroic episodes of the war. The
airman started on the enterprise alone in a
biplane. On arrival at Courtrai he glided down
to a height of 300 feet and dropped a large
bomb on the railway junction. While he did this
he was the target of hundreds of rifles, of machine
guns, and of anti-aircraft armament, and
was severely wounded in the thigh. Though he
might have saved his life by at once coming
down in the enemy's lines, he decided to save
his machine at all costs, and made for the British
lines. Descending to a height of only 100
feet in order to increase his speed, he continued
to fly and was again wounded, this time
mortally. He still flew on, however, and without
coming down at the nearest of our aerodromes
went all the way back to his own base,
where he executed a perfect landing and made
his report. He died in hospital not long afterward.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Steadiness
of the
Canadians.</div>

<p>The outstanding feature of the action of the
past week has been the steadiness of our troops
on the extreme left; but of the deeds of individual
gallantry and devotion which have
been performed it would be impossible to narrate
one-hundredth part. At one place in this
quarter a machine gun was stationed in the
angle of a trench when the German rush took
place. One man after another of the detachment
was shot, but the gun still continued in
action, through five bodies lay around it. When<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
the sixth man took the place of his fallen comrades,
of whom one was his brother, the Germans
were still pressing on. He waited until
they were only a few yards away, and then
poured a stream of bullets on to the advancing
ranks, which broke and fell back, leaving
rows of dead. He was then wounded himself.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Telephone
wires cut.</div>

<p>Under the hot fire to which our batteries
were subjected in the early part of the engagement
telephone wires were repeatedly cut. The
wire connecting one battery with its observing
officer was severed on nine separate occasions,
and on each occasion repaired by a Sergeant,
who did the work out in the open under a perfect
hail of shells.</p>

<p>About 5 P. M. a dense cloud of suffocating
vapors was launched from their trenches along
the whole front held by the French right and
by our left from the Ypres-Langemarck road to
a considerable distance east of St. Julien. The
fumes did not carry much beyond our front
trenches. But these were to a great extent
rendered untenable, and a retirement from
them was ordered.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Strange
appearance
of
gas battle.</div>

<p>No sooner had this started than the enemy
opened a violent bombardment with asphyxiating
shells and shrapnel on our trenches and on
our infantry as they were withdrawing. Meanwhile
our guns had not been idle. From a distance,
perhaps owing to some peculiarity of the
light, the gas on this occasion looked like a
great reddish cloud, and the moment it was seen
our batteries poured a concentrated fire on the
German trenches.</p>

<p>Curious situations then arose between us and
the enemy. The poison belt, the upper part
shredding into thick wreaths of vapor as
it was shaken by the wind, and the lower
and denser part sinking into all inequalities
of the ground, rolled slowly down the trenches.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
Shells would rend it for a moment, but it only
settled down again as thickly as before.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the German infantry faced it,
and they faced a hail of shrapnel as well. In
some cases where the gas had not reached our
lines our troops held firm and shot through
the cloud at the advancing Germans. In other
cases the men holding the front line managed
to move to the flank, where they were more or
less beyond the affected area. Here they waited
until the enemy came on and then bayoneted
them when they reached our trenches.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A charge
through
the gas.</div>

<p>On the extreme left our supports waited
until the vapor reached our trenches, when
they charged through it and met the advancing
Germans with the bayonet as they swarmed
over the parapets.</p>

<p>South of St. Julien the denseness of the
vapor compelled us to evacuate trenches, but
reinforcements arrived who charged the enemy
before they could establish themselves in position.
In every case the assaults failed completely.
Large numbers were mown down by
our artillery. Men were seen falling and others
scattering and running back to their own lines.
Many who reached the gas cloud could not
make their way through it, and in all probability
a great number of the wounded perished
from the fumes.</p>

<p>It is to that extent, from a military standpoint,
a sign of weakness. Another sign of
weakness is the adoption of illegal methods of
fighting, such as spreading poisonous gas. It
is a confession by the Germans that they have
lost their former great superiority in artillery
and are, at any cost, seeking another technical
advantage over their enemy as a substitute.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
enemy
sticks at
nothing.</div>

<p>Nevertheless, this spirit, this determination
on the part of our enemies to stick at nothing
must not be underestimated. Though it may
not pay the Germans in the long run, it renders<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
it all the more obvious that they are a foe that
can be overcome only by the force of overwhelming
numbers of men and guns.</p>

<p>Further to the east a similar attack was
made about 7 P. M. which seems to have been
attended with even less success, and the assaulting
infantry was at once beaten back by our artillery
fire.</p>

<p>It was not long before all our trenches were
reoccupied and the whole line reestablished in
its original position. The attack on the French
met with the same result.</p>

<p>Prisoners captured in the recent fighting, the
narrative continues, stated that one German
corps lost 80 per cent. of its men in the first
week; that the losses from our artillery fire,
even during days when no attacks were taking
place, had been very heavy and that many of
their own men had suffered from the effects of
the gas.</p>

<div class="sidenote">German
gains due
to poison
gas.</div>

<p>In regard to the recent fighting on our left,
the German offensive, effected in the first instance
by surprise, resulted in a considerable
gain of ground for the enemy. Between all
the earlier German efforts, the only difference
was that on this latest occasion the attempt
was carried out with the aid of poisonous gases.</p>

<p>There is no reason why we should not expect
similar tactics in the future. They do
not mean that the Allies have lost the initiative
in the Western theatre, nor that they are likely
to lose it. They do mean, however, and the fact
has been repeatedly pointed out, that the
enemy's defensive is an active one, that his confidence
is still unshaken and that he still is
able to strike in some strength where he sees
the chance or where mere local advantage can
be secured.</p>

<p>The true idea of the meaning of the operations
of the Allies can be gained only by bearing
in mind that it is their primary object to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
bring about the exhaustion of the enemy's resources
in men.</p>

<p>In the form now assumed by this struggle&mdash;a
war of attrition&mdash;the Germans are bound
ultimately to lose, and it is the consciousness
of this fact that inspires their present policy.
This is to achieve as early as possible some
success of sufficient magnitude to influence the
neutrals, to discourage the Allies, to make them
weary of the struggle and to induce the belief
among the people ignorant of war that nothing
has been gained by the past efforts of the Allies
because the Germans have not yet been driven
back. It is being undertaken with a political
rather than a strategical object.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Violent
artillery
fire.</div>

<p>The calm that prevailed Thursday and Friday
proved to be only the lull before the storm.
Early Saturday morning it became apparent
that the Germans were preparing an attack in
strength against our line running east and
northeast from Ypres, for they were concentrating
under cover of a violent artillery fire,
and at about 10 o'clock the battle began in
earnest.</p>

<p>At that hour the Germans attacked our line
from the Ypres-Poelcappelle road to within a
short distance of the Menin highroad, it being
evidently their intention while engaging us
closely on the whole of this sector to break our
front in the vicinity of the Ypres-Roulers Railway,
to the north and to the south of which
their strongest and most determined assaults
were delivered.</p>

<p>Under this pressure our front was penetrated
at some points around Frezenberg, and at 4:30
o'clock in the afternoon we made a counter-attack
between the Zonnebeke road and the railway
in order to recover the lost ground. Our
offensive was conducted most gallantly, but
was checked before long by the fire of machine
guns.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Enemy
attacks
near
Menin
road.</div>

<p>Meanwhile, the enemy launched another attack
through the woods south of the Menin
road, and at the same time threatened our left
to the north of Ypres with fresh masses. Most
desperate fighting ensued, the German infantry
coming on again and again and gradually forcing
our troops back, though only for a short
distance, in spite of repeated counter-attacks.</p>

<div class="sidenote">On the
Poelcappelle
road.</div>

<p>During the night the fighting continued to
rage with ever-increasing fury. It is impossible
to say at exactly what hour our line was broken
at different points, but it is certain that at one
time the enemy's infantry poured through
along the Poelcappelle road, and even got as
far as Wieltje at 9 P. M.</p>

<p>There was also a considerable gap in our
front about Frezenberg, where hostile detachments
had penetrated. At both points counter-attacks
were organized without delay. To the
east of the salient the Germans first were driven
back to Frezenberg, but there they made a firm
stand, and under pressure of fresh reinforcements
we fell back again toward Verlorenhoek.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Canadian
counter-attack.</div>

<p>Northeast of the salient a counter-attack carried
out by us about 1 A. M. was more successful.
Our troops swept the enemy out of Wieltje
at the bayonet's point, leaving the village
strewn with German dead and, pushing on, regained
most of the ground to the north of that
point. And so the fight surged to and fro
throughout the night. All around the scene of
the conflict the sky was lit up by the flashes of
the guns and the light of blazing villages and
farms, while against this background of smoke
and flame, looking out in the murky light over
the crumbling ruins of the old town, rose the
battered wreck of the cathedral town and the
spires of Cloth Hall.</p>

<div class="sidenote">German
assaults
on the
east.</div>

<p>When Sunday dawned there came a short respite,
and the firing for a time died down. The
comparative lull enabled us to reorganize and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
consolidate our position on the new line we had
taken up and to obtain some rest after the
fatigue and strain of the night. It did not
last long, however, and in the afternoon the
climax of the battle was reached, for, under the
cover of intense artillery fire, the Germans
launched no less than five separate assaults
against the east of the salient.</p>

<p>To the north and northeast their attacks were
not at first pressed so hard as on the south of
the Menin road, where the fighting was especially
fierce. In the latter direction masses of
infantry were hurled on with absolute desperation
and were beaten off with corresponding
slaughter.</p>

<p>At one point, north of the town, 500 of the
enemy advanced from the wood, and it is affirmed
by those present that not a single man
of them escaped.</p>

<div class="sidenote">German
losses at
Ch&acirc;teau
Hooge.</div>

<p>On the eastern face, at 6:30 P. M., an endeavor
was made to storm the grounds of the
Ch&acirc;teau Hooge, a little north of the Menin
road, but the force attempting it broke and fell
back under the hail of shrapnel poured upon
them by our guns. It was on this side, where
they had to face the concentrated fire of guns,
Maxims and rifles again and again in their efforts
to break their way through, that the Germans
incurred their heaviest losses, and the
ground was literally heaped with dead.</p>

<p>They evidently, for the time being at least,
were unable to renew their efforts, and as night
came on the fury of their offensive gradually
slackened, the hours of darkness passing in
quietness.</p>

<p>During the day our troops saw some of the
enemy busily employed in stripping the British
dead in our abandoned trenches, east of the
Hooge Ch&acirc;teau, and several Germans afterward
were noticed dressed in khaki.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A successful
day.</div>

<p>So far as the Ypres region is concerned, this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
for us was a most successful day. Our line,
which on the northeast of the salient had, after
the previous day's fighting, been reconstituted
a short distance behind the original front, remained
intact. Our losses were comparatively
slight, and, owing to the targets presented by
the enemy, the action resolved itself on our
part into pure killing.</p>

<p>The reason for this very determined effort to
crush our left on the part of the Germans is
not far to seek. It is probable that for some
days previously they had been in possession of
information which led them to suppose that
we intended to apply pressure on the right of
our line, and that their great attack upon Ypres
on the 7th, 8th, and 9th was undertaken with
a view to diverting us from our purpose.</p>

<p>In this the Germans were true to their principles,
for they rightly hold that the best manner
of meeting an expected hostile offensive is
to forestall it by attacking in some other
quarter. In this instance their leaders acted
with the utmost determination and energy and
their soldiers fought with the greatest courage.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
enemy
held in
check.</div>

<p>The failure of their effort was due to the
splendid endurance of our troops, who held the
line around the salient under a fire which again
and again blotted out whole lengths of the
defenses and killed the defenders by scores.
Time after time along those parts of the front
selected for assault were parapets destroyed,
and time after time did the thinning band of
survivors build them up again and await the
next onset as steadily as before.</p>

<p>Here, in May, in defense of the same historic
town, have our incomparable infantry repeated
the great deeds their comrades performed half
a year ago and beaten back most desperate onslaughts
of hostile hordes backed by terrific artillery
support.</p>

<p>The services rendered by our troops in this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
quarter cannot at present be estimated, for
their full significance will only be realized in
the light of future events. But so far their
devotion has indirectly contributed in no small
measure to the striking success already
achieved by our allies.</p>

<p>Further south, in the meantime, on Sunday
another struggle had been in progress on that
portion of the front covered by the right of
our line and the left of the French, for when
the firing around Ypres was temporarily subsiding
during the early hours of the morning
another and even more tremendous cannonade
was suddenly started by the artillery of the
Allies some twenty miles to the south.</p>

<p>The morning was calm, bright, and clear, and
opposite our right, as the sun rose, the scene in
front of our line was the most peaceful imaginable.
Away to the right were Guinchy, with
its brickfields and the ruins of Givenchy. To
the north of them lay low ground, where, hidden
by trees and hedgerows, ran the opposing
lines that were about to become the scene of the
conflict, and beyond, in the distance, rose the
long ridge of Aubers, the villages crowning it
standing out clear cut against the sky.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Bombardment
of
Guinchy.</div>

<p>At 5 o'clock the bombardment began, slowly
at first and then growing in volume until the
whole air quivered with the rush of the larger
shells and the earth shook with the concussion
of guns. In a few minutes the whole distant
landscape disappeared in smoke and dust,
which hung for a while in the still air and
then drifted slowly across the line of battle.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
battle
near
Festubert.</div>

<p>Shortly before 6 o'clock our infantry advanced
along our front between the Bois
Grenier and Festubert. On the left, north of
Fromelles, we stormed the German first line
trenches. Hand-to-hand fighting went on for
some time with bayonet, rifle, and hand grenade,
but we continued to hold on to this position<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
throughout the day and caused the enemy
very heavy loss, for not only were many Germans
killed in the bombardment, but their repeated
efforts to drive us from the captured
positions proved most costly.</p>

<p>On the right, to the north of Festubert, our
advance met with considerable opposition and
was not pressed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A French
victory.</div>

<p>Meanwhile, the French, after a prolonged
bombardment, had taken the German positions
north of Arras on a front of nearly five miles,
and had pushed forward from two to three
miles, capturing 2,000 prisoners and six guns.
This remarkable success was gained by our
allies in the course of a few hours.</p>

<p>As may be supposed from the nature of the
fighting which has been in progress, our losses
have been heavy. On other parts of the front our
action was confined to that of the artillery, but
this proved most effective later, all the communications
of the enemy being subjected to
so heavy and accurate a fire that in some
quarters all movement by daylight within
range of our lines was rendered impracticable.
At one place opposite our centre a convoy of
ammunition was hit by a shell, which knocked
out six motor lorries and caused two to blow up.
Opposite our centre we fired two mines, which
did considerable damage to the enemy's defenses.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Air
fighting.</div>

<p>During the day also our aeroplanes attacked
several points of importance. One of our airmen,
who was sent to bomb the canal bridge
near Don, was wounded on his way there, but
continued and fulfilled his mission. Near
Wytschaete, one of our aviators pursued a German
aeroplane and fired a whole belt from his
machine gun at it. The Taube suddenly
swerved, righted itself for a second, and then
descended from a height of several thousand
feet straight to the ground.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>On the other hand, a British machine unfortunately
was brought down over Lille by the
enemy's anti-aircraft guns, but it is hoped that
the aviator escaped.</p>

<p><i>In regard to the German allegation, that the
British used gas in their attacks on Hill 60,
the Eyewitness says:</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">British
had not
used gas.</div>

<p>No <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'asphxiating'">asphyxiating</ins> gases have been employed by

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Germany, desperate at her failure to win the
rapid victories she had anticipated on the land,
resorted, in 1915, to a ruthless policy of sinking
the ships of the belligerent powers, whether or
not they were engaged on legitimate errands.
This policy culminated on May 7, 1915, in the
sinking of the great transatlantic steamship
the <i>Lusitania</i>, with the loss of over a thousand
men, women, and children.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>
<h2>SINKING OF THE LUSITANIA</h2>

<h3>THE JUDICIAL DECISION BY
JUDGE J. M. MAYER</h3>


<div class="sidenote">The
<i>Lusitania</i>
sails.</div>

<p>On May 1, 1915, the British passenger-carrying
merchantman <i>Lusitania</i> sailed
from New York bound for Liverpool,
with 1,257 passengers and a crew of 702, making
a total of 1,959 souls on board, men, women,
and children. At approximately 2:10 on
the afternoon of May 7, 1915, weather clear
and sea smooth, without warning, the vessel
was torpedoed and went down by the head in
about eighteen minutes, with an ultimate tragic
loss of 1,195.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Passengers and
equipment.</div>

<p>So far as equipment went, the vessel was
seaworthy in the highest sense. Her carrying
capacity was 2,198 passengers and a crew of
about 850, or about 3,000 persons in all. She had
22 open lifeboats capable of accommodating 1,322
persons, 26 collapsible boats with a capacity
for 1,283, making a total of 48 boats with a
capacity for 2,605 in all, or substantially in
excess of the requirements of her last voyage.
Her total of life belts was 3,187, or 1,959 more
than the total number of passengers, and, in addition,
she carried 20 life buoys. She was
classed 100 A1 at Lloyd's being 787 feet long
over all, with a tonnage of 30,395 gross and 12,611
net. She had 4 turbine engines, 25 boilers,
4 boiler rooms, 12 transverse bulkheads, dividing
her into 13 compartments, with a longitudinal
bulkhead on either side of the ship for
425 feet, covering all vital parts.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
<i>Lusitania</i>
unarmed.</div>

<p>The proof is absolute that she was not and
never had been armed nor did she carry any explosives.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
She did carry some 18 fuse cases and
125 shrapnel cases, consisting merely of empty
shells without any powder charge, 4,200 cases
of safety cartridges, and 189 cases of infantry
equipment, such as leather fittings, pouches,
and the like. All these were for delivery
abroad, but none of these munitions could be
exploded by setting them on fire in mass or in
bulk, nor by subjecting them to impact. She
had been duly inspected on March 17, April
15, 16, and 17, all in 1915, and before she left
New York the boat gear and boats were examined,
overhauled, checked up, and defective
articles properly replaced.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The drills
sufficient.</div>

<p>There is no reason to doubt that this part of
her equipment was in excellent order when she
left New York. The vessel was under the command
of a long service and experienced Captain
and officered by competent and experienced
men. The difficulties of the war prevented the
company from gathering together a crew fully
reaching a standard as high as in normal times,
(many of the younger British sailors having
been called to the colors,) but, all told, the crew
was good and, in many instances, highly intelligent
and capable. Due precaution was taken
in respect of boat drills while in port, and the
testimony shows that those drills were both
sufficient and efficient. Some passengers did
not see any boat drills on the voyage, while
others characterized the drills, in effect, as
formally superficial. Any one familiar with
ocean traveling knows that it is not strange
that boat drills may take place unobserved by
some of the passengers who, though on deck,
may be otherwise occupied or who may be in
another part of the ship, and such negative
testimony must give way to the positive testimony
that there were daily boat drills, the object
of which mainly was to enable the men
competently and quickly to lower the boats.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Emergency
precautions.</div>

<p>Each man had a badge showing the number
of the boat to which he was assigned, and a
boat list was posted in three different places in
the ship. Each day of the voyage a drill was
held with the emergency boat, which was a fixed
boat, either No. 13 on the starboard side or No.
14 on the port side, according to the weather,
the idea, doubtless, being to accustom the men
quickly to reach the station on either side of
the ship. The siren was blown and a picked
crew from the watch assembled at the boat, put
on life belts, jumped into the boat, took their
places, and jumped out again.</p>

<p>Throughout this case it must always be
remembered that the disaster occurred in May,
1915, and the whole subject must be approached
with the knowledge and mental attitude of that
time. It may be that more elaborate and effective
methods and precaution have been
adopted since then, but there is no testimony
which shows that these boat drills, as practiced
on the voyage, were not fully up to the then
existing standards and practices. There can
be no criticism of the bulkhead door drills, for
there was one each day.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Speed
reduced.</div>

<p>In November, 1914, the Directors of the
Cunard Company, in view of the falling off of
the passenger traffic, decided to withdraw the
<i>Lusitania's</i> sister ship, <i>Mauretania</i>, and to run
the <i>Lusitania</i> at three-fourths boiler power,
which involved a reduction of speed from an
average of about twenty-four knots to an average
of about twenty-one knots. The ship was
operated under this reduced boiler power and
reduced rate of speed for six round trips until
and including the fatal voyage, although at the
reduced rate she was considerably faster than
any passenger ship crossing the Atlantic at
that time. This reduction was in part for financial
reasons and in part "a question of economy
of coal and labor in time of war." No<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
profit was expected and none was made, but the
company continued to operate the ship as a public
service. The reduction from twenty-four
to twenty-one knots is, however, quite immaterial
to the controversy, as will later appear.</p>

<p>Having thus outlined the personnel, equipment,
and cargo of the vessel, reference will
now be made to a series of events preceding her
sailing on May 1, 1915.</p>

<p>On February 4, 1915, the Imperial German
Government issued a proclamation as follows:</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
German
proclamation.</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"1. The waters surrounding Great Britain
and Ireland, including the whole English Channel,
are hereby declared to be war zone. On and
after the 18th of February, 1915, every enemy
merchant ship found in the said war zone will
be destroyed without its being always possible
to avert the dangers threatening the crews and
passengers on that account.</p>

<p>"2. Even neutral ships are exposed to danger
in the war zone, as in view of the misuse of
neutral flags ordered on January 31 by the
British Government and of the accidents of
naval war, it cannot always be <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'advoided'">avoided</ins> to
strike even neutral ships in attacks that are
directed at enemy ships.</p>

<p>"3. Northward navigation around the Shetland
Islands, in the eastern waters of the North
Sea and in a strip of not less than thirty miles
width along the Netherlands coast is in no
danger.</p>

<div class='sig'>
<span style="margin-right: 4em;">"<span class="smcap">Von Pohl</span>,</span><br />
"Chief of the Admiral Staff of the Navy.<br /></div>
"Berlin, February 4, 1915."<br />
</div>

<div class="sidenote">Submarine
blockade
declared.</div>

<p>This was accompanied by a so-called memorial,
setting forth the reasons advanced by
the German Government in support of the issuance
of this proclamation, an extract from
which is as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Just as England declared the whole North
Sea between Scotland and Norway to be comprised<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
within the seat of war, so does Germany
now declare the waters surrounding Great
Britain and Ireland, including the whole English
Channel, to be comprised within the seat
of war, and will prevent by all the military
means at its disposal all navigation by the
enemy in those waters. To this end it will endeavor
to destroy, after February 18 next, any
merchant vessels of the enemy which present
themselves at the seat of war above indicated,
although it may not always be possible to avert
the dangers which may menace persons and
merchandise. Neutral powers are accordingly
forewarned not to intrust their crews, passengers,
or merchandise to such vessels."</p></div>

<div class="sidenote">Protests
sent by
the United
States.</div>

<p>To this proclamation and memorial the
Government of the United States made due protest
under date of February 10, 1915. On the
same day protest was made to England by this
Government regarding the use of the American
flag by the <i>Lusitania</i> on its voyage through the
war zone on its trip from New York to Liverpool
of January 30, 1915, in response to which,
on February 19, Sir Edward Grey, Secretary of
State for Foreign Affairs, handed a memorandum
to Mr. Page, the American Ambassador to
England, containing the following statement:</p>

<div class="sidenote">British
reply to
American
protest.</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It is understood that the German Government
had announced their intention of sinking
British merchant vessels at sight by torpedoes
without giving any opportunity of making any
provisions for saving the lives of noncombatant
crews and passengers. It was in consequence
of this threat that the <i>Lusitania</i> raised the
United States flag on her inward voyage and
on her subsequent outward voyage. A request
was made by the United States passengers who
were embarking on board her that the United
States flag should be hoisted, presumably to insure
their safety."</p></div>

<p>The British Ambassador, the Hon. Cecil<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
Spring-Rice, on March 1, 1915, in a communication
to the American Secretary of State regarding
an economic blockade of Germany, stated
in reference to the German proclamation of
February 4:</p>

<div class="sidenote">British
statement
on the
submarine
blockade.</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Germany has declared that the English
Channel, the north and west coasts of France,
and the waters around the British Isles are a
war area and has officially notified that all
enemy ships found in that area will be destroyed,
and that neutral vessels may be exposed
to danger. This is in effect a claim to
torpedo at sight, without regard to the safety
of the crew or passengers, any merchant vessel
under any flag. As it is not in the power of
the German Admiralty to maintain any surface
craft in these waters, this attack can only be
delivered by submarine agency."</p></div>

<div class="sidenote">Submarines
sink
merchant
ships.</div>

<p>Beginning with the 30th of January, 1915,
and prior to the sinking of the <i>Lusitania</i> on
May 7, 1915, German submarines attacked and
seemed to have sunk twenty merchant and
passenger ships within about 100 miles of the
usual course of the <i>Lusitania</i>, chased two other
vessels which escaped, and damaged still another.</p>

<p>It will be noted that nothing is stated in the
German memorandum as to sinking enemy
merchant vessels without warning, but, on the
contrary, the implication is that settled international
law as to visit and search and an opportunity
for the lives of passengers to be safeguarded
will be obeyed, "although it may not
always be possible to avert the dangers which
may menace persons and merchandise."</p>

<p>As a result of this submarine activity, the
<i>Lusitania</i> on its voyages from New York to
Liverpool, beginning with that of January 30,
1915, steered a course further off from the south
coast of Ireland than formerly.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Precautions in
danger
zone.</div>

<p>In addition, after the German proclamation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
of February 4, 1915, the <i>Lusitania</i> had its boats
swung out and provisioned while passing
through the danger zone, did not use its wireless
for sending messages, and did not stop at
the Mersey Bar for a pilot, but came directly
up to its berth.</p>

<p>The petitioner and the master of the <i>Lusitania</i>
received certain advices from the British
Admiralty on February 10, 1915, as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Vessels navigating in submarine areas
should have their boats turned out and fully
provisioned. The danger is greatest in the vicinity
of ports and off prominent headlands on the
coast. Important landfalls in this area should
be made after dark whenever possible. So far as
is consistent with particular trades and state of
tides, vessels should make their ports at dawn."</p></div>

<div class="sidenote">Advices
from the
British
Admiralty.</div>

<p>On April 15 and 16, 1915, and after the last
voyage from New York, preceding the one on
which the <i>Lusitania</i> was torpedoed, the Cunard
Company and the master of the <i>Lusitania</i> received
at Liverpool the following advices from
the British Admiralty:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Confidential Daily Voyage Notice 15th
April, 1915, issued under Government War
Risks Scheme.</p>

<p>"German submarines appear to be operating
chiefly off prominent headlands and landfalls.
Ships should give prominent headlands a wide
berth.</p>

<p>"Confidential memorandum issued 16th
April, 1915:</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fast
steamers
follow a
zigzag
course.</div>

<p>"War experience has shown that fast steamers
can considerably reduce the chance of successful
surprise submarine attacks by zigzagging&mdash;that
is to say, altering the course at
short and irregular intervals, say in ten minutes
to half an hour. This course is almost invariably
adopted by warships when cruising in
an area known to be infested by submarines.
The underwater speed of a submarine is very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
slow and it is exceedingly difficult for her to get
into position to deliver an attack unless she can
observe and predict the course of the ship
attacked."</p></div>

<p>Sir Alfred Booth, Chairman of the Cunard
Line, was a member of the War Risks Committee
at Liverpool, consisting of ship owners,
representatives of the Board of Trade and the
Admiralty, which received these instructions
and passed them on to the owners of vessels,
including the Cunard Company, which distributed
them to the individual masters.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Advertisement
in
the New
York
papers.</div>

<p>On Saturday, May 1, 1915, the advertised
sailing date of the <i>Lusitania</i> from New York
to Liverpool on the voyage on which she was
subsequently sunk, there appeared the following
advertisement in the New York "Times,"
New York "Tribune," New York "Sun," New
York "Herald," and the New York "World,"
this advertisement being in all instances except
one placed directly over, under, or adjacent to
the advertisement of the Cunard Line, regarding
the sailing of the <i>Lusitania:</i></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Travelers intending to embark on the Atlantic
voyage are reminded that a state of war
exists between Germany and her allies and
Great Britain and her allies. That the zone
of war includes the waters adjacent to the British
Isles. That in accordance with formal notice
given by the Imperial German Government,
vessels flying the flag of Great Britain or of
any of her allies are liable to destruction in
those waters, and that travelers sailing in the
war zone on ships of Great Britain or her
allies do so at their own risk."</p>

<div class='sig'>
"<span class="smcap">Imperial German Embassy</span>,<br />
"April 22, 1915.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Washington, D. C."<br />
</div></div>

<p>This was the first insertion of this advertisement,
although it was dated more than a week
prior to its publication. Captain Turner, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
master of the vessel, saw the advertisement or
"something of the kind" before sailing, and
realized that the <i>Lusitania</i> was included in the
warning. The Liverpool office of the Cunard
Company was advised of the sailing and the
number of passengers by cable from the New
York office, but no mention was made of the
above quoted advertisement. Sir Alfred Booth
was informed through the press of this advertisement
on either Saturday evening, May 1,
or Sunday morning, May 2.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Lusitania</i>
justified
in sailing.</div>

<p>The significance and construction to be given
to this advertisement will be discussed infra,
but it is perfectly plain that the master was
fully justified in sailing on the appointed day
from a neutral port with many neutral and
non-combatant passengers, unless he and his
company were willing to yield to the attempt
of the German Government to terrify British
shipping. No one familiar with the British
character would expect that such a threat
would accomplish more than to emphasize the
necessity of taking every precaution to protect
life and property which the exercise of judgment
would invite.</p>

<p>And so, as scheduled, the <i>Lusitania</i> sailed,
undisguised, with her four funnels and a figure
so familiar as to be readily discernible not only
by naval officers and marines, but by the ocean-going
public generally.</p>

<div class="sidenote">In the
submarine
war zone.</div>

<p>The voyage was uneventful until May 6. On
approaching the Irish coast on May 6 the Captain
ordered all the boats hanging on the davits
to be swung out and lowered to the promenade
deckrail, and this order was carried out under
the supervision of Staff Captain Anderson, who
later went down with the ship. All bulkhead
doors which were not necessary for the working
of the ship were closed, and it was reported
to Captain Turner that this had been done.
Lookouts were doubled, and two extra were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
put forward and one on either side of the
bridge; that is, there were two lookouts in the
crow's-nest, two in the eyes of the ship, two
officers on the bridge, and a quartermaster on
either side of the bridge.</p>

<p>Directions were given to the engine room to
keep the highest steam they could possibly get
on the boilers, and in case the bridge rang for
full speed, to give as much as they possibly
could. Orders were also given that ports
should be kept closed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Wireless
messages
from the
Admiralty.</div>

<p>At 7:50 P. M., on May 6, the <i>Lusitania</i> received
the following wireless message from the
Admiral at Queenstown: "Submarines active
off south coast of Ireland," and at 7:56 the
vessel asked for and received a repetition of
his message. The ship was then going at a
rate of 21 knots per hour.</p>

<p>At 8:30 P. M. of the same day the following
message was received from the British Admiralty:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"To All British Ships 0005:</p>

<p>"Take Liverpool pilot at bar and avoid headlands.
Pass harbors at full speed; steer midchannel
course. Submarines off Fastnet."</p></div>

<div class="sidenote">The <i>Lusitania's</i>
speed
reduced.</div>

<p>At 8:32 the Admiralty received a communication
to show that this message had been received
by the <i>Lusitania</i>, and the same message
was offered to the vessel seven times between
midnight of May 6 and 10 A. M. of May 7.</p>

<p>At about 8 A. M. on the morning of May 7,
on approaching the Irish coast, the vessel encountered
an intermittent fog, or Scotch mist,
called "banks" in seafaring language, and the
speed was reduced to 15 knots. Previously the
speed, according to Captain Turner's recollection,
had been reduced to 18 knots. This adjustment
of speed was due to the fact that Captain
Turner wished to run the last 150 miles
of the voyage in the dark, so as to make Liverpool
early on the morning of May 8, at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
earliest time when he could cross the bar without
a pilot.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Approaching
the
most
dangerous
waters.</div>

<p>Judging from the location of previous submarine
attacks, the most dangerous waters in
the <i>Lusitania's</i> course were from the entrance
to St. George's Channel to Liverpool Bar.
There is no dispute as to the proposition that
a vessel darkened is much safer from submarine
attack at night than in the daytime, and Captain
Turner exercised proper and good judgment
in planning accordingly as he approached
dangerous waters. It is futile to conjecture as
to what would or would not have happened had
the speed been higher prior to the approach to
the Irish coast, because, obviously, until then
the Captain could not figure out his situation,
not knowing how he might be impeded by fog
or other unfavorable weather conditions.</p>

<p>On the morning of May 7, 1915, the ship
passed about twenty-five or twenty-six, and, in
any event, at least eighteen and a half miles
south of Fastnet, which was not in sight. The
course was then held up slightly to bring the
ship closer to land, and a little before noon
land was sighted, and what was thought to be
Brow Head was made out.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, between 11 A. M. and noon, the
fog disappeared, the weather became clear, and
the speed was increased to 18 knots. The
course of the vessel was S. 87 E. Mag. At
11:25 A. M. Captain Turner received the
following message:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Submarines active in southern part of Irish
Channel, last heard of twenty miles south of
Coningbeg. Light vessel make certain '<i>Lusitania</i>'
gets this."</p></div>

<div class="sidenote">Submarines
reported
by wireless.</div>

<p>At 12:40 P. M. the following additional wireless
message from the Admiralty was received:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Submarines five miles south of Cape Clear,
proceeding west when sighted at 10 A. M."</p></div>

<p>After picking up Brow Head and at about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
12:40 P. M., the course was altered in shore
by about 30 degrees, to about N. 63 or 67 E.
Mag., Captain Turner did not recall which.
Land was sighted which the Captain thought
was Galley Head, but he was not sure, and
therefore held in shore. This last course was
continued for an hour at a speed of 18 knots
until 1:40 P. M., when the Old Head of Kinsale
was sighted and the course was then changed
back to the original course of S. 87 E. Mag.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
<i>Lusitania</i>
torpedoed.</div>

<p>At 1:50 P. M. the Captain started to take a
four-point bearing on the Old Head of Kinsale,
and while thus engaged and at about 2:30
P. M., as heretofore stated, the ship was torpedoed
on the starboard side. Whether one, two,
or three torpedoes were fired at the vessel cannot
be determined with certainty. Two of the
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'ships's'">ship's</ins> crew were confident that a third torpedo
was fired and missed the ship. While not
doubting the good faith of these witnesses, the
evidence is not sufficiently satisfactory to be
convincing.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Conflicting
testimony.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Probably
two
torpedoes.</div>

<div class="sidenote">No explosives
on board.</div>

<p>There was, however, an interesting and remarkable
conflict of testimony as to whether
the ship was struck by one or two torpedoes,
and witnesses, both passengers and crew, differed
on this point, conscientiously and emphatically.
The witnesses were all highly intelligent,
and there is no doubt that all testified to
the best of their recollection, knowledge, or impression,
and in accordance with their honest
conviction. The weight of the testimony (too
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'volminous'">voluminous</ins> to analyze) is in favor of the "two
torpedo" contention, not only because of some
convincing direct testimony, (as, for instance,
Adams, Lehman, Morton,) but also because of
the unquestioned surrounding circumstances.
The deliberate character of the attack upon a
vessel whose identity could not be mistaken,
made easy on a bright day, and the fact that
the vessel had no means of defending herself,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
would lead to the inference that the submarine
commander would make sure of her destruction.
Further, the evidence is overwhelming
that there was a second explosion. The
witnesses differ as to the impression which
the sound of this explosion made upon them&mdash;a
natural difference due to the fact, known
by common experience, that persons who hear
the same explosion even at the same time
will not only describe the sound differently, but
will not agree as to the number of detonations.
As there were no explosives on board, it is difficult
to account for the second explosion, except
on the theory that it was caused by a second
torpedo. Whether the number of torpedoes was
one or two is relevant, in this case, only upon
the question of what effect, if any, open ports
had in accelerating the sinking of the ship.</p>

<p>While there was much testimony and some
variance as to the places where the torpedoes
struck, judged by the sound or shock of the explosions,
certain physical effects, especially as
to smoke and blown-up d&eacute;bris, tend to locate
the areas of impact with some approach of
accuracy.</p>

<p>From all the testimony it may be reasonably
concluded that one torpedo struck on the starboard
side somewhere abreast of No. 2 boiler
room and the other, on the same side, either
abreast of No. 3 boiler room or between No. 3
and No. 4. From knowledge of the torpedoes
then used by the German submarines, it is
thought that they would effect a rupture of the
outer hull thirty to forty feet long and ten to
fifteen feet vertically.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Flooding
of boiler
rooms
and
coal bunkers.</div>

<p>Cockburn, senior Second Engineer, was of
opinion that the explosion had done a great
deal of internal damage. Although the lights
were out, Cockburn could hear the water coming
into the engine room. Water at once entered
No. 1 and No. 2 boiler rooms, a result<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
necessarily attributable to the fact that one or
both of the coal bunkers were also blown open.
Thus, one torpedo flooded some or all of the
coal bunkers on the starboard side of Nos. 1
and 2 boiler rooms, and apparently flooded both
boiler rooms.</p>

<p>The effect of the other torpedo is not entirely
clear. If it struck midway between two bulkheads,
it is quite likely to have done serious
bulkhead injury. The <i>Lusitania</i> was built so
as to float with two compartments open to the
sea, and with more compartments open she
could not stay afloat. As the side coal bunkers
are regarded as compartments, the ship could
not float with two boiler rooms flooded and also
an adjacent bunker, and, therefore, the damage
done by one torpedo was enough to sink the
ship.</p>

<p>To add to the difficulties, all the steam had
gone as the result of the explosions, and the
ship could not be controlled by her engines.</p>

<p>Little, senior Third Engineer, testified that
in a few seconds after the explosion the steam
pressure fell from 190 to 50 pounds, his explanation
being that the main steam pipes or boilers
had been carried away.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Engines
disabled.</div>

<p>The loss of control of and by the engines resulted
in disability to stop the engines, with the
result that the ship kept her headway until she
sank. That the ship commenced to list to starboard
immediately is abundantly established by
many witnesses.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The ship's
behavior
in going
down.</div>

<p>Some of the witnesses, (Lauriat and Adams,
passengers; Duncan, Bestic, and Johnson, officers,)
testified that the ship stopped listing
to starboard and started to recover and then
listed again to starboard until she went over.</p>

<p>This action, which is quite likely, must have
resulted from the inrush of water on the port
side. There can be no other adequate explanation
consistent with elementary scientific<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
knowledge; for, if the ship temporarily righted
herself, it must have been because the weight
of water on the two sides was equal or nearly
so. The entry of water into the port side must,
of course, have been due to some rupture on
that side. Such a result was entirely possible,
and, indeed, probable.</p>

<p>The explosive force was sufficiently powerful
to blow d&eacute;bris far above the radio wires&mdash;i. e.,
more than 160 feet above the water. The boiler
rooms were not over sixty feet wide, and so
strong a force could readily have weakened the
longitudinal bulkheads on the port side in addition
to such injury as flying metal may have
done. It is easy to understand, therefore, how
the whole pressure of the water rushing in from
the starboard side against the weakened longitudinal
bulkheads on the port side would cause
them to give way and thus open up some
apertures on the port side for the entry of
water. Later, when the water continued to
rush in on the starboard side, the list to starboard
naturally again occurred, increased and
continued to the end. As might be expected,
the degree of list to starboard is variously described,
but there is no doubt that it was steep
and substantial.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ports had
all been
ordered
closed.</div>

<p>A considerable amount of testimony was
taken upon the contention of claimants that
many of the ship's ports were open, thus reducing
her buoyancy and substantially hastening
her sinking. There is no doubt that on
May 6 adequate orders were given to close all
ports. The testimony is conclusive that the
ports on Deck F (the majority of which were
dummy ports) were closed. Very few, if any,
ports on E deck were open, and, if so, they were
starboard ports in a small section of the first
class in the vicinity where one of the torpedoes
did its damage. A very limited number
of passengers testified that the portholes in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
their staterooms were open, and if their
impressions are correct, these portholes, concerning
which they testified, were all, or nearly
all, so far above the water that they could not
have influenced the situation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sinking
not affected
by open
ports.</div>

<p>There was conflicting testimony as to the
ports in the dining room on D deck. The weight
of the testimony justifies the conclusion that
some of these ports were open&mdash;how many it is
impossible to determine. These ports, however,
were from twenty-three to thirty feet above
water, and when the gap made by the explosion
and the consequent severe and sudden list are
considered, it is plain that these open ports
were not a contributing cause of the sinking,
and had a very trifling influence, if any, in accelerating
the time within which the ship sank.</p>

<p>From the foregoing the situation can be visualized.
Two sudden and extraordinary explosions,
the ship badly listed so that the port side
was well up in the air, the passengers scattered
about on the decks and in the staterooms,
saloons and companion ways, the ship under
headway and, as it turned out, only eighteen
minutes afloat&mdash;such was the situation which
confronted the officers, crew, and passengers
in the endeavor to save the lives of those on
board.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Calm
heroism
of the
passengers.</div>

<p>The conduct of the passengers constitutes an
enduring record of calm heroism with many individual
instances of sacrifice and, in general,
a marked consideration for women and children.
There was no panic, but naturally, there
was a considerable amount of excitement and
rush and much confusion, and, as the increasing
list rendered ineffective the lowering of the
boats on the port side, the passengers, as is
readily understandable, crowded over on the
starboard side.</p>

<p>The problem presented to the officers of the
ship was one of exceeding difficulty, occasioned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
largely because of the serious list and the impossibility
of stopping the ship or reducing her
headway.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lookouts
sighted
the
torpedo.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Boats
ordered
lowered.</div>


<p>The precaution of extra lookouts resulted in
a prompt report to the Captain, via the bridge,
of the sighting of the torpedo. Second Officer
Heppert, who was on the bridge, immediately
closed all watertight doors worked from the
bridge, and the testimony satisfactorily shows
that all watertight doors worked by hand were
promptly closed. Immediately after Captain
Turner saw the wake of the torpedo there was
an explosion and then Turner went to the navigation
bridge and took the obvious course, i. e.,
had the ship's head turned to the land. He
signaled the engine room for full speed astern,
hoping thereby to take the way off the ship,
and then ordered the boats lowered down to the
rail and directed that women and children
should be first provided for in the boats. As
the engine room failed to respond to the order
to go full speed astern, and as the ship was continuing
under way, Turner ordered that the
boats should not be lowered until the vessel
should lose her headway, and he told Anderson,
the Staff Captain, who was in charge of the
port boats, to lower the boats when he thought
the way was sufficiently off to allow that operation.
Anderson's fidelity to duty is sufficiently
exemplified by the fact that he went down with
the ship.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
officers
display
courage
and skill.</div>

<p>Jones, First Officer, and Lewis, Acting Third
Officer, were in charge of the boats on the starboard
side and personally superintended their
handling and launching. Too much cannot be
said both for their courage and skill, but, difficult
as was their task, they were not confronted
with some of the problems which the port side
presented. There, in addition to Anderson,
were Bestic, Junior Third Officer, and another
officer, presumably the Second Officer. These<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
men were apparently doing the best they could
and standing valiantly to their duty. Anderson's
fate has already been mentioned, and
Bestic, although surviving, stuck to his post
until the ship went down under him. The
situation can readily be pictured even by a
novice.</p>

<p>With the ship listed to starboard, the port
boats, of course, swung inboard. If enough
man power were applied, the boats could be
put over the rail, but then a real danger would
follow. Robertson, the ship's carpenter, aptly
described that danger in answer to a question
as to whether it was possible to lower the open
boats on the port side. He said:</p>

<div class="sidenote">Port boats
could
not be
lowered.</div>

<p>"No. To lower the port boats would just be
like drawing a crate of unpacked china along
a dock road. What I mean is that if you
started to lower the boats you would be dragging
them down the rough side of the ship on
rivets which are what we call "snap-headed
rivets"&mdash;they stand up about an inch from the
side of the ship, so you would be dragging the
whole side of the boat away if you tried to
lower the boats with a 15-degree list."</p>

<p>That some boats were and others would have
been seriously damaged is evidenced by the
fact that two port boats were lowered to the
water and got away, (though one afterward
filled,) and not one boat reached Queenstown.</p>

<p>Each boat has its own history, (except possibly
Boats 2 and 4,) although it is naturally
difficult, in each case, to allocate all the testimony
to a particular boat.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Accidents
in lowering.</div>

<p>There is some testimony, given in undoubted
good faith, that painted or rusted davits stuck
out, but the weight of the testimony is to the
contrary. There were some lamentable occurrences
on the port side, which resulted in
spilling passengers, some of whom thus thrown
out or injured went to their death. These unfortunate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
accidents, however, were due either
to lack of strength of the seaman who was
lowering, or possibly, at worst, to an occasional
instance of incompetency due to the personal
equation so often illustrated, where one man
of many may not be equal to the emergency.
But the problem was of the most vexatious
character. In addition to the crowding of
passengers in some instances was this extremely
hazardous feat of lowering boats swung
inboard from a tilted height, heavily weighted
by human beings, with the ship still under way.
It cannot be said that it was negligent to attempt
this, because, obviously, all the passengers
could not be accommodated in the starboard
boats.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Six boats
get away
from starboard.</div>

<p>On the starboard side, the problem, in some
respects, was not so difficult, while, in others,
troublesome conditions existed quite different
from those occurring on the port side. Here
the boats swung so far out as to add to the
difficulty of passengers getting in them, a difficulty
intensified by the fact that many more
passengers went to the starboard side than to
the port side and, also that the ship maintained
her way. Six boats successfully got away. In
the case of the remaining boats, some were successfully
lowered but later met with some unavoidable
accident, and some were not successfully
launched (such as Nos. 1, 5, and 17) for
entirely explainable reasons which should not
be charged to inefficiency on the part of the
officers or crew.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Collapsible
boats
cut loose.</div>

<p>The collapsible boats were on the deck under
the open lifeboats, and were intended to be
lifted and lowered by the same davits which
lowered the open boats after the open boats
had gotten clear of the ship. It was the duty
of the officers to get the open boats away before
giving attention to the collapsible boats, and
that was a question of time. These boats are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
designed and arranged to float free if the ship
should sink before they can be hoisted over.
They were cut loose and some people were saved
on these boats.</p>

<p>It is to be expected that those passengers
who lost members of their family or friends,
and who saw some of the unfortunate accidents,
should feel strongly and entertain the
impression that inefficiency or individual negligence
was widespread among the crew. Such
an impression, however, does an inadvertent
injustice to the great majority of the crew, who
acted with that matter-in-fact courage and
fidelity to duty which are traditional with men
of the sea. Such of these men, presumably
fairly typical of all, as testified in this court,
were impressive not only because of inherent
bravery, but because of intelligence and clear-headedness,
and they possessed that remarkable
gift of simplicity so characteristic of truly
fearless men who cannot quite understand why
an ado is made of acts which seem to them
merely the day's work.</p>

<p>Mr. Grab, one of the claimants and an experienced
transatlantic traveler, concisely
summed up the situation when he said:</p>

<p>"They were doing the best they could&mdash;they
were very brave and working as hard as they
could without any fear. They didn't care about
themselves. It was very admirably done.
While there was great confusion, they did the
best they could."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Captain
Turner's
comment
on the
crew.</div>

<p>It will unduly prolong a necessarily extended
opinion to sift the voluminous testimony relating
to this subject of the boats and the conduct
of the crew and something is sought to
be made of comments of Captain Turner, construed
by some to be unfavorable but afterward
satisfactorily supplemented and explained,
but if there were some instances of
incompetency they were very few and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
charge of negligence in this regard cannot be
successfully maintained.</p>

<p>In arriving at this conclusion, I have not
overlooked the argument earnestly pressed that
the men were not sufficiently instructed and
drilled; for I think the testimony establishes
the contrary in the light of conditions in May,
1915.</p>

<p>I now come to what seems to be the only
debatable question of fact in the case, i. e.,
whether Captain Turner was negligent in not
literally following the Admiralty advices and,
also, in not taking a course different from that
which he adopted.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Captain's
judgment
free.</div>

<p>The fundamental principle in navigating a
merchantman, whether in times of peace or of
war, is that the commanding officer must be
left free to exercise his own judgment. Safe
navigation denies the proposition that the
judgment and sound discretion of the Captain
of a vessel must be confined in a mental straitjacket.
Of course, when movements are under
military control, orders must be strictly obeyed,
come what may. No such situation, however,
was presented either to the Cunard Steamship
Co. or Captain Turner. The vessel was not
engaged in military service nor under naval
convoy. True, she was, as between the German
and British Governments, an enemy ship as
to Germany, but she was unarmed and a
carrier of not merely noncombatants, but,
among others, of many citizens of the United
States, then a neutral country, at peace with
all the world.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Admiralty
advices
considered.</div>

<p>In such circumstances the Captain could not
shield himself automatically against error behind
a literal compliance with the general advices
or instructions of the Admiralty, nor can
it be supposed that the Admiralty, any more
than the Cunard Steamship Co., expected him
so to do. What was required of him was that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
he should seriously consider and, as far as
practicable, follow the Admiralty advices and
use his best judgment as events and exigencies
occurred; and if a situation arose where he
believed that a course should be pursued to
meet emergencies which required departure
from some of the Admiralty advices as to general
rules of action, then it was his duty to take
such course, if in accordance with his carefully
formed deliberate judgment. After a
disaster has occurred, it is not difficult for the
expert to show how it might have been avoided,
and there is always opportunity for academic
discussion as to what ought or ought not to
have been done; but the true approach is to
endeavor, for the moment, to possess the mind
of him upon whom rested the responsibility.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Enemy
obligations in
care of
merchant ships.</div>

<p>Let us now see what that responsibility was
and how it was dealt with. The rules of naval
warfare allowed the capture and, in some circumstances,
the destruction of an enemy merchant
ship, but, at the same time, it was the
accepted doctrine of all civilized nations (as
will be more fully considered infra) that, as
Lord Mersey put it, "there is always an obligation
first to secure the safety of the lives of
those on board."</p>

<p>The responsibility, therefore, of Captain
Turner, in his task of bringing the ship safely
to port, was to give heed not only to general
advices advanced as the outcome of experience
in the then developing knowledge as to submarine
warfare, but particularly to any special
information which might come to him in the
course of the voyage.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Advices
of the
Admiralty.</div>

<p>Realizing that if there was a due warning,
in accordance with international law, and an
opportunity, within a limited time, for the
passengers to leave the ship, nevertheless that
the operation must be quickly done, Captain
Turner, on May 6, had taken the full precautions,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
such as swinging out the boats, properly
provisioned, which have been heretofore described.
The principal features of the Admiralty
advices were (1) to give the headlands
a wide berth; (2) to steer a midchannel course;
(3) to maintain as high a speed as practicable;
(4) to zigzag, and (5) to make ports, if
possible, at dawn, thus running the last part
of the voyage at night.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fastnet
given
a wide
berth.</div>

<p>The reason for the advice as to keeping off
headlands was that the submarines lurked near
those prominent headlands and landfalls to
and from which ships were likely to go. This
instruction Captain Turner entirely followed
in respect of Fastnet, which was the first point
on the Irish coast which a vessel bound from
New York to Liverpool would ordinarily
approach closely, and, in normal times, the
passing would be very near, or even inside of
Fastnet. The <i>Lusitania</i> passed Fastnet so far
out that Captain Turner could not see it.
Whether the distance was about twenty-five
miles, as the Cunard Steamship Co. contends,
or about eighteen and one-half miles, as the
claimants calculate, the result is that either
distance must be regarded as a wide berth, in
comparison with the customary navigation at
that point, and, besides, nothing happened
there. At 8:30 P. M. on May 6 the message had
been received from the British Admiralty that
submarines were off Fastnet, so that Captain
Turner, in this regard, not only followed the
general advices, but the specific information
from the Admiralty.</p>

<p>At 11:25 A. M. on May 7 Captain Turner received
the wireless from the Admiralty plainly
intended for the <i>Lusitania</i>, informing him that
submarines (plural) were active in the southern
part of the Irish Channel and when last
heard of were twenty miles south of Coningbeg
Light Vessel. This wireless message presented<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
acutely to the Captain the problem as to the
best course to pursue, always bearing in mind
his determination and the desirability of getting
to the Liverpool Bar when it could be
crossed while the tide served and without a
pilot. Further, as was stated by Sir Alfred
Booth, "The one definite instruction we did
give him with regard to that was to authorize
him to come up without a pilot." The reasons
for this instruction were cogent and were
concisely summed up by Sir Alfred Booth during
his examination as a witness as follows:</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Mersey
sandbar.</div>

<p>"It was one of the points that we felt it necessary
to make the Captain of the <i>Lusitania</i> understand
the importance of. The <i>Lusitania</i> can
only cross the Liverpool Bar at certain states
of the tide, and we therefore warned the
Captain, or whoever might be Captain, that we
did not think it would be safe for him to arrive
off the bar at such a time that he would have
to wait there, because that area had been
infested with submarines, and we thought
therefore it would be wiser for him to arrange his
arrival in such a way, leaving him an absolutely
free hand as to how he would do it, that he
could come straight up without stopping at
all. The one definite instruction we did give
him with regard to that was to authorize him
to come up without a pilot."</p>

<p>The tide would be high at Liverpool Bar at
6:53 on Saturday morning, May 8. Captain
Turner planned to cross the bar as much earlier
than that as he could get over without stopping,
while at the same time figuring on passing during
the darkness the dangerous waters from
the entrance of St. George's Channel to the
Liverpool Bar.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Captain
decides
to work
inshore.</div>

<p>Having thus in mind his objective, and the
time approximately when he intended to reach
it, the message received at 11:25 A. M. required
that he should determine whether to keep off<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
land approximately the same distance as he
was when he passed Fastnet, or to work inshore
and go close to Coningbeg Lightship. He
determined that the latter was the better plan
to avoid the submarines reported in midchannel
ahead of him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Taking a
bearing.</div>

<p>When Galley Head was sighted the course
was changed so as to haul closer to the land,
and this course was pursued until 1:40 P. M.,
at which time Captain Turner concluded that
it was necessary for him to get his bearings
accurately. This he decided should be done by
taking a four-point bearing, during which procedure
the ship was torpedoed. It is urged
that he should have taken a two-point bearing
or a cross bearing, which would have occupied
less time, but if, under all the conditions which
appealed to his judgment as a mariner, he had
taken a different method of ascertaining his
exact distance and the result would have been
inaccurate, or while engaged in taking a two-point
bearing the ship had been torpedoed,
then somebody would have said he should have
taken a four-point bearing. The point of the
matter is that an experienced Captain took
the bearing he thought proper for his purposes,
and to predicate negligence upon such a course
is to assert that a Captain is bound to guess
the exact location of a hidden and puzzling
danger.</p>

speed.</div>

<p>Much emphasis has been placed upon the fact
that the speed of the ship was eighteen knots
at the time of the attack instead of twenty-four,
or, in any event, twenty-one knots, and upon
the further fact (for such it is) that the ship
was not zigzagging as frequently as the Admiralty
advised or in the sense of that advice.</p>

<p>Upon this branch of the case much testimony
was taken, (some in camera, as in the
Wreck Commissioners' Court,) and, for reasons
of public interest, the methods of successfully<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
evading submarines will not be discussed. If
it be assumed that the Admiralty advices as of
May, 1915, were sound and should have been
followed, then the answer to the charge of
negligence is twofold: (1) that Captain Turner,
in taking a four-point bearing off the Old Head
of Kinsale, was conscientiously exercising his
judgment for the welfare of the ship, and (2)
that it is impossible to determine whether, by
zigzagging off the Old Head of Kinsale or elsewhere,
the <i>Lusitania</i> would have escaped the
German submarine or submarines.</p>

<p>As to the first answer I cannot better express
my conclusion <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'that'">than</ins> in the language of
Lord Mersey:</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lord
Mersey's
opinion.</div>

<p>"Captain Turner was fully advised as to the
means which in the view of the Admiralty were
best calculated to avert the perils he was likely
to encounter, and in considering the question
whether he is to blame for the catastrophe in
which his voyage ended I have to bear this
circumstance in mind. It is certain that in
some respects Captain Turner did not follow
the advice given to him. It may be (though
I seriously doubt it) that had he done so his
ship would have reached Liverpool in safety.
But the question remains: Was his conduct
the conduct of a negligent or of an incompetent
man? On this question I have sought the
guidance of my assessors, who have rendered
me invaluable assistance, and the conclusion
at which I have arrived is that blame ought not
to be imputed to the Captain. The advice given
to him, although meant for his most serious
and careful consideration, was not intended to
deprive him of the right to exercise his skilled
judgment in the difficult questions that might
arise from time to time in the navigation of
his ship. His omission to follow the advice in
all respects cannot fairly be attributed either
to negligence or incompetence.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Skilled
and experienced
judgment.</div>

<p>"He exercised his judgment for the best. It
was the judgment of a skilled and experienced
man, and although others might have acted
differently, and, perhaps, more successfully, he
ought not, in my opinion, to be blamed."</p>

<div class="sidenote">More
than one
submarine
in wait.</div>

<p>As to the second answer, it is only necessary
to outline the situation in order to realize
how speculative is the assertion of fault. It
is plain from the radio messages of the Admiralty,
(May 6, 7:50 P. M., "Submarines active
off south coast of Ireland"; May 6, 8:30 P. M.,
"Submarines off Fastnet"; the 11:25 message
of May 7, supra; May 7, 11:40 A. M.,
"Submarines five miles south of Cape Clear,
proceeding west when sighted at 10 A. M.,") that
more than one submarine was lying in wait
for the <i>Lusitania</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Submarines
bold with
unarmed
vessels.</div>

<p>A scientific education is not necessary to
appreciate that it is much more difficult for a
submarine successfully to hit a naval vessel
than an unarmed merchant ship. The destination
of a naval vessel is usually not known,
that of the <i>Lusitania</i> was. A submarine commander,
when attacking an armed vessel, knows
that he, as the attacker, may and likely will
also be attacked by his armed opponent. The
<i>Lusitania</i> was as helpless in that regard as a
peaceful citizen suddenly set upon by murderous
assailants. There are other advantages of
the naval vessel over the merchant ship which
need not be referred to.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Probably
two submarines.</div>

<p>It must be assumed that the German submarine
commanders realized the obvious disadvantages
which necessarily attached to the
<i>Lusitania</i>, and, if she had evaded one submarine,
who can say what might have happened
five minutes later? If there was, in fact, a
third torpedo fired at the <i>Lusitania's</i> port
side, then that incident would strongly suggest
that, in the immediate vicinity of the ship,
there were at least two submarines.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<p>It must be remembered also that the <i>Lusitania</i>
was still in the open sea, considerably
distant from the places of theretofore submarine
activity and comfortably well off the Old
Head of Kinsale, from which point it was about
140 miles to the Scilly Islands, and that she
was nearly 100 miles from the entrance to St.
George's Channel, the first channel she would
enter on her way to Liverpool.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Attack
intended
to destroy
life.</div>

<p>No transatlantic passenger liner, and certainly
none carrying American citizens, had
been torpedoed up to that time. The submarines,
therefore, could lay their plans with
facility to destroy the vessel somewhere on the
way from Fastnet to Liverpool, knowing full
well the easy prey which would be afforded by
an unarmed, unconvoyed, well-known merchantman,
which from every standpoint of international
law had the right to expect a warning
before its peaceful passengers were sent to their
death. That the attack was deliberate and long
contemplated and intended ruthlessly to destroy
human life, as well as property, can no
longer be open to doubt. And when a foe employs
such tactics it is idle and purely speculative
to say that the action of the Captain of
a merchant ship, in doing or not doing something
or in taking one course and not another,
was a contributing cause of disaster or that had
the Captain not done what he did or had he
done something else, then that the ship and
her passengers would have evaded their assassins.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Captain
and company
not
negligent.</div>

<p>I find, therefore, as a fact, that the Captain
and, hence, the Cunard Company were not
negligent.</p>

<p>The importance of the cause, however, justifies
the statement of another ground which effectually
disposes of any question of liability.</p>

<p>It is an elementary principle of law that
even if a person is negligent recovery cannot<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
be had unless the negligence is the proximate
cause of the loss or damage.</p>

<p>There is another rule, settled by ample authority,
viz.: that, even if negligence is shown,
it cannot be the proximate cause of the loss
or damage if an independent illegal act or a
third party intervenes to cause the loss.</p>

<p>The question, then, is whether the act of the
German submarine commander was an illegal act.</p>

<div class="sidenote">International
law.</div>

<p>The United States courts recognize the binding
force of international law.</p>

<p>At least since as early as June 5, 1793, in
the letter of Mr. Jefferson, Secretary of State,
to the French Minister, our Government has
recognized the law of nations as an "integral
part" of the laws of the land.</p>

<p>To ascertain international law, "resort must
be had to the customs and usages of civilized
nations; and, as evidence of these, to the works
of commentators and jurists. * * * Such
works are resorted to by judicial tribunals
* * * for trustworthy evidence of what the
law really is."</p>

<p>Let us first see the position of our Government,
and then ascertain whether that position
has authoritative support. Mr. Lansing, in his
official communication to the German Government
dated June 9, 1915, stated:</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mr. Lansing's
communication.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Responsibility
of the
German
Government.</div>

<div class="sidenote">A principle
of humanity.</div>

<p>"But the sinking of passenger ships involves
principles of humanity which throw into the
background any special circumstances of detail
that may be thought to affect the cases,
principles which lift it, as the Imperial German
Government will no doubt be quick to
recognize and acknowledge, out of the class of
ordinary subjects of diplomatic discussion or
of international controversy. Whatever be the
other facts regarding the <i>Lusitania</i>, the principal
fact is that a great steamer, primarily
and chiefly a conveyance for passengers, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
carrying more than a thousand souls who had
no part or lot in the conduct of the war, was torpedoed
and sunk without so much as a challenge
or a warning, and that men, women, and
children were sent to their death in circumstances
unparalleled in modern warfare. The
fact that more than one hundred American
citizens were among those who perished made
it the duty of the Government of the United
States to speak of these things and once more
with solemn emphasis to call the attention of
the Imperial German Government to the grave
responsibility which the Government of the
United States conceives that it has incurred
in this tragic occurrence, and to the indisputable
principle upon which that responsibility
rests. The Government of the United States is
contending for something much greater than
mere rights of property or privileges of commerce.
It is contending for nothing less high
and sacred than the rights of humanity, which
every Government honors itself in respecting
and which no Government is justified in resigning
on behalf of those under its care and
authority. Only her actual resistance to capture
or refusal to stop when ordered to do so
for the purpose of visit could have afforded
the commander of the submarine any justification
for so much as putting the lives of
those on board the ship in jeopardy. This
principle the Government of the United States
understands the explicit instructions issued on
August 3, 1914, by the Imperial German Admiralty
to its commanders at sea to have
recognized and embodied as do the naval codes
of all other nations, and upon it every traveler
and seaman had a right to depend. It is upon
this principle of humanity, as well as upon
the law founded upon this principle, that the
United States must stand. * * *</p>

<div class="sidenote">Americans
must be
safeguarded.</div>

<p>"The Government of the United States cannot<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
admit that the proclamation of a war zone
from which neutral ships have been warned to
keep away may be made to operate as in any
degree an abbreviation of the rights either of
American shipmasters or of American citizens
bound on lawful errands as passengers on merchant
ships of belligerent nationality. It does
not understand the Imperial German Government
to question those rights. It understands
it, also, to accept as established beyond question
the principle that the lives of non-combatants
cannot lawfully or rightfully be put in
jeopardy by the capture or destruction of an
unresisting merchantman, and to recognize the
obligation to take sufficient precaution to ascertain
whether a suspected merchantman is
in fact of belligerent nationality or is in fact
carrying contraband of war under a neutral
flag. The Government of the United States
therefore deems it reasonable to expect that
the Imperial German Government will adopt
the measures necessary to put these principles
into practice in respect of the safeguarding of
American lives and American ships, and asks
for assurances that this will be done. (See
White Book of Department of State entitled
'Diplomatic Correspondence with Belligerent
Governments Relating to Neutral Rights and
Duties, European War, No. 2,' at p. 172.
Printed and distributed October 21, 1915.)"</p>

<p>The German Government found itself compelled
ultimately to recognize the principles insisted
upon by the Government of the United
States, for, after considerable correspondence,
and on May 4, 1916, (after the <i>Sussex</i>
had been sunk,) the German Government stated:</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
<i>Sussex</i>
agreement.</div>

<p>"The German submarine forces have had in
fact, orders to conduct <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'submarines'">submarine</ins> warfare in
accordance with the general principles of visit
and search and destruction of merchant vessels<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
as recognized by international law, the sole
exception being the conduct of warfare against
the enemy trade carried on enemy freight ships
that are encountered in the war zone surrounding
Great Britain. * * *</p>

<div class="sidenote">Merchant
ships
not to
be sunk
without
warning.</div>

<p>"The German Government, guided by this
idea, notifies the Government of the United
States that the German naval forces have received
the following orders: In accordance with
the general principles of visit and search and
destruction of merchant vessels recognized by
international law, such vessels, both within and
without the area declared as naval war zone,
shall not be sunk without warning and without
saving human lives, unless these ships attempt
to escape or offer resistance. See Official Communication
by German Foreign Office to Ambassador
Gerard, May 4, 1916. (White Book
No. 3 of Department of State, pp. 302, 305.)"</p>

<div class="sidenote">Right to
make a
prize.</div>

<p>There is, of course, no doubt as to the right
to make prize of an enemy ship on the high
seas, and, under certain conditions, to destroy
her, and equally no doubt of the obligation to
safeguard the lives of all persons aboard,
whether passengers or crew.</p>

<p>Two quotations from a long list of authorities
may be given for convenience, one stating
the rule and the other the attitude which obtains
among civilized Governments. Oppenheim
sets forth as among violations of the rules
of war:</p>

<p>"(12) Attack on enemy merchantmen without
previous request to submit to visit."</p>

<p>The observation in Vattel's "Law of Nations"
is peculiarly applicable to the case of the
<i>Lusitania:</i></p>

<p>"Let us never forget that our enemies are men.
Though reduced to the disagreeable necessity of
prosecuting our right by force of arms, let us
not divest ourselves of that charity which connects
us with all mankind. Thus shall we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
courageously defend our country's rights without
violating those of human nature. Let our
valor preserve itself from every stain of cruelty
and the lustre of victory will not be tarnished
by inhuman and brutal actions."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Codes and
rules of
nations.</div>

<p>In addition to these authorities are the regulations
and practices of various Governments.
In 1512 Henry VIII. issued instructions to the
Admiral of the Fleet which accord with our
understanding of modern international law.
Such has been England's course since.</p>

<p>Substantially the same rules were followed
in the Russian and Japanese regulations, and
probably in the codes or rules of many other
nations.</p>

<p>The rules recognized and practiced by the
United States, among other things, provide:</p>

<p>"(10) In the case of an enemy merchantman
it may be sunk, but only if it is impossible to
take it into port, and provided always that the
persons on board are put in a place of safety.
(U. S. White Book, European War, No. 3, p.
192.)"</p>

<div class="sidenote">Humane
principles
in
American
wars.</div>

<p>These humane principles were practiced both
in the war of 1812 and during our own war of
1861-65. Even with all the bitterness (now
happily ended and forgotten) and all the difficulties
of having no port to which to send a
prize, Captain Semmes of the <i>Alabama</i> strictly
observed the rule as to human life, even going
so far as to release ships because he could not
care for the passengers. But we are not confined
to American and English precedents and
practices.</p>

<p>While acting contrary to its official statements,
yet the Imperial German Government
recognized the same rule as the United States,
and prior to the sinking of the <i>Lusitania</i> had
not announced any other rule. The war zone
proclamation of February 4, 1915, contained no
warning that the accepted rule of civilized naval<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
warfare would be discarded by the German
Government.</p>

<p>Indeed, after the <i>Lusitania</i> was sunk, the
German Government did not make any such
claim, but in answer to the first American note
in reference to the <i>Lusitania</i> the German Foreign
Office, per von Jagow, addressed to Ambassador
Gerard a note dated May 18, 1915, in
which, inter alia, it is stated in connection with
the sinking of the British steamer <i>Falaba:</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">The
<i>Falaba</i>
case.</div>

<p>"In the case of the sinking of the English
steamer <i>Falaba</i>, the commander of the German
submarine had the intention of allowing passengers
and crew ample opportunity to save
themselves. It was not until the Captain disregarded
the order to lay to and took to flight,
sending up rocket signals for help, that the
German commander ordered the crew and passengers
by signals and megaphone to leave the
ship within ten minutes. As a matter of fact,
he allowed them twenty-three minutes, and did
not fire the torpedo until suspicious steamers
were hurrying to the aid of the <i>Falaba</i>. (White
Book <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'N.'">No.</ins> 2, U. S. Department of State, p. 169.)"</p>

<p>Indeed, as late as May 4, 1916, Germany did
not dispute the applicability of the rule, as is
evidenced by the note written to our Government
by von Jagow of the German Foreign
Office, an extract of which has been quoted
supra.</p>

<p>Further, Section 116 of the German Prize
Code, (Huberich and Kind translation, p. 68,)
in force at the date of the <i>Lusitania's</i> destruction,
conformed with the American rule. It
provided:</p>

<div class="sidenote">Safety of
passengers
necessary.</div>

<p>"Before proceeding to a destruction of the
vessel the safety of all persons on board, and,
so far as possible, their effects, is to be provided
for, and all ship's papers and other evidentiary
material which, according to the views
of the persons at interest, is of value for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
formulation of the judgment of the prize court,
are to be taken over by the commander."</p>

<p>Thus, when the <i>Lusitania</i> sailed from New
York, her owner and master were justified in
believing that, whatever else and theretofore
happened, this simple, humane and universally
accepted principle would not be violated. Few,
at that time, would be likely to construe the
warning advertisement as calling attention to
more than the perils to be expected from quick
disembarkation and the possible rigors of the
sea after the proper safeguarding of the lives
of passengers by at least full opportunity to
take to the boats.</p>

<p>It is, of course, easy now in the light of many
later events, added to preceding acts, to look
back and say that the Cunard Line and its Captain
should have known that the German
Government would authorize or permit so
shocking a breach of international law and so
foul an offense, not only against an enemy, but
as well against peaceful citizens of a then
friendly nation.</p>

<p>But the unexpected character of the act was
best evidenced by the horror which it excited
in the minds and hearts of the American people.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fault
with the
Imperial
German
Government.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Those who
plotted
the crime.</div>

<p>The fault, therefore, must be laid upon those
who are responsible for the sinking of the vessel,
in the legal as well as moral sense. It is,
therefore, not the Cunard Line, petitioner,
which must be held liable for the loss of life
and property. The cause of the sinking of the
<i>Lusitania</i> was the illegal act of the Imperial
German Government, acting through its instrument,
the submarine commander, and violating
a cherished and humane rule observed, until
this war, by even the bitterest antagonists. As
Lord Mersey said, "The whole blame for the
cruel destruction of life in this catastrophe
must rest solely with those who plotted and
with those who committed the crime."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span></p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Italy, bound at the outbreak of the war to
Germany and Austria by a treaty which formed
the so-called Triple Alliance, was in a most
difficult position. Her people, however, were
strongly convinced of the aggressive intentions
of Germany, and, after careful consideration,
the Government and the people alike decided
to cast their lot with the Allies. Active operations
were at once begun along the border between
Italy and Austria, and in this difficult
terrain the events which are described in the
following chapter occurred.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span></p>






<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>MOUNTAIN WARFARE</h2>

<h3>HOWARD C. FELTON</h3>


<div class="sidenote">New style
of warfare.</div>

<p>At the outbreak of the great war huge and
well-equipped bodies of men, led by
highly trained officers, rich in the strategic
lore of centuries, set out to demonstrate
the value of the theories that they had learned
in time of peace. In a few months an entirely
new style of warfare developed, and most of
the military learning of the past was interesting
chiefly because of its antiquity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Italy and
Austria
fight in
the Alps.</div>

<p>After the tremendous conflict at the Marne
and the German rush for Calais, which was
halted on the line of the Yser, there were on
the western front no more battles in the old
sense of the word. From the North Sea to the
Swiss frontier, the fighting was just a novel
and gigantic form of siege warfare. Cavalry
became an obsolete arm. Battle tactics, in the
old sense, ceased to have any meaning. Of
strategy nothing much remained save the dictionary
definition.</p>

<p>And now, since Italy and Austria have locked
horns above the clouds, among the glaciers
and snow-faced slopes of the Alps, even the old
text-books on mountain warfare have lost their
significance. In the Trentino and along the
Isonzo we see the consummation of a new style
of mountain fighting, which grew out of the
old methods in the struggle for the Carpathian
passes during the first winter and spring of
the war.</p>


<p>In the old days, during a campaign in a
mountain region, most of the battles were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
fought on the level&mdash;in the literal, not the colloquial
sense of the word. There was a deal of
marching and scouting among crags and precipices,
but all with the object of obtaining the
best position in an open valley or upland plain
where the real fighting must take place. Now
the smooth floors of the valleys are comparatively
deserted, while whole armies are spread
out over great peaks and dizzy snow-fields thousands
of feet above sea-level, chopping trenches
in the ice and sparring for some vantage-point
on <ins title="Transcriber's Note: this word not present in original">a</ins> crag that in peace times might tax the
strength and skill of the amateur mountain-climber.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Bourcet's
"Principles
of
Mountain
Warfare."</div>

<p>Some time between 1764 and 1770, Pierre de
Bourcet wrote a treatise entitled "The Principles
of Mountain Warfare." This may seem
to be going a long way back, but Bourcet's
volume and that of the young Comte de Guilbert
on general tactics have historical interest
and importance because, according to Spenser
Wilkinson, they show where some of Napoleon's
strategic "miracles" were born. Bourcet's
observations are as vital as if they had been
written in 1910, but, as will be seen, many of
them are somewhat musty in 1916.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Passes
and defiles
once the
strong
positions.</div>

<p>Bourcet, without the slightest idea of a
battle-line extending from frontier to sea, lays
down as the first principle of mountain warfare
that when the enemy holds a strong position,
the assailant should force him to leave it
by turning it. These strong positions in the
mountains were, until this war, the passes and
defiles.</p>

<p>"These contracted places," he explains, "as
they generally constitute the principal objects
of the defense, must compel the general who
is taking the offensive to seek every possible
means of turning them, or of misleading the
enemy by diversions which will weaken him
and facilitate access to them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span></p>

<p>"Suppose, for example, that the general on
the defensive should be entrenched at all points
surrounding his position in such a way as to
be able to resist any direct attack that might
be attempted against him, it would be necessary
to attempt to turn him by some more
distant point, choosing positions that would
facilitate the scheme, and which, by suggesting
some different object, could not raise the suspicion
that the troops there collected were
destined for the purpose really in view.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Unlike
modern
warfare.</div>

<p>"It often happens in the mountains that the
only passages favorable to our plans are interrupted
by narrow defiles. In such cases we
must avoid letting the enemy know our real
purpose, and must undertake diversions, dividing
our forces into small bodies. This method,
which would be dangerous in any other sort of
country, is indispensable in the mountains,
and is the whole science of this kind of warfare,
provided that the general who uses it always
has the means to reconcentrate his forces
when necessary."</p>

<p>Bourcet's conclusion is that in such a
campaign the offensive has great advantages
over the defensive. It will always possess the
initiative; and if it prepares its blow with sufficient
secrecy and strikes swiftly, the enemy,
whose troops are necessarily scattered along
the whole line menaced, can never be ready to
meet the attack.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Generals
understand
each
other's
strategy.</div>

<p>To-day, the only trouble about this beautifully
tricky system of strategy is that the defending
general would pay no attention to it.
The Austrian general staff, for instance, knew
that the Italians would try to smash through
the frontier defenses of the Dual Empire, and
that the natural avenues of attack were up the
valley of the Adige, along the railway through
Pontebba and Malborghetto, or between Malborghetto
and the sea. The Austrians have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
enough men and guns to defend all these routes
and all the tortuous pathways in between. So
all they had to do was plant themselves on
their chosen ground along the whole carefully
fortified mountain line, and wait for the
Italians to attack wherever they pleased.</p>

<p>"It is only by marching and countermarching,"
Bourcet said, "that we can hope to deceive
the enemy and induce him to weaken himself
in certain positions in order to strengthen himself
in others."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
enemy
cannot
be outflanked.</div>

<p>But this cannot be done in the mountain
fighting in the Alps to-day. The Italians might
march and countermarch as much as they
pleased, but there is no possible way of turning
the enemy out of his position by outflanking
him. It is a case of frontal attack, with
every valley blocked and every peak a fortress.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Italy's
great objectives.</div>

<p>The Italians campaign has two principal objectives&mdash;Trent
and Gorizia. These two lovely
cities of Italia Irrendenta are respectively the
keys to the right and left flank of the Austrian
frontier. Trent guards the valley of the Adige,
one of the few natural highways from Italy into
Austrian territory. Bourcet himself, in 1735,
designed the defense of this pathway at Rivoli,
just inside the Italian boundary, where he laid
out what were considered impregnable positions.
To the north; where Trent lies, the
country becomes more and more difficult for
an invader, and up to this time the Italians
have not been able to come within striking distance
of the great Austrian fortress, though
they hold Rovereto, and have cut the direct
line of communication between Trent and
Toblach.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Italian
game on
the
Gorizia
front.</div>

<p>On the Gorizia front they have made what in
this war may be considered as important gains.
Gorizia stands watch over the valley of the
Isonzo and Austria's Adriatic littoral. Besides
occupying Grado and Monfalcone in the coastlands,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
General Cadorna's forces have crossed
the Isonzo at several points, have smashed
through to the north, and now threaten to
envelop Gorizia. Indeed, many observers believe
that Cadorna could at any time take the
place by a grand assault if he were willing to
pay the cost in blood.</p>

<p>Despite the very unfavorable character of
the country, the Italians have gained more
ground here in the same period than either the
Germans or the Anglo-French forces in the flat
or rolling plains of Flanders and northern
France. But the outflanking tactics of Bourcet,
with feints and swift maneuvering, have had
little to do with it. The assailants have had to
fight their way step by step.</p>

<p>The Austrians had prepared all sorts of
disagreeable surprises. They had hewn gun-positions
out of solid cliffs, skilfully placed so
as to cover the routes of approach, and had
cemented up the embrasures. It was merely
necessary to knock the cement out and pour
shells upon the advancing Italians at a range
of several miles. The batteries were inaccessible
to storming parties, and the Italians had
to drag up guns of equal caliber to put them
out of business.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ancient
methods
employed.</div>

<p>In some places rocks and masses of ice were
rolled down the slopes, as in the brave old days
of the Helvetians; and in this line the Austrians
introduced an innovation. When the
Italians began driving their trenches up the
steep slopes of Podgora&mdash;the Gibraltar of
Gorizia&mdash;the defenders rolled down barrels of
kerosene and set them alight with artillery fire.
This enterprise throve joyously until the Italian
gunners got the range of the launching-point
and succeeded in exploding a few barrels
among the Austrians themselves.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Austria
had possession
of the
heights.</div>

<p>The writer does not mean to give the impression
that Italy's job in the Alps is all but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
finished. A glance at the map of the frontier
will cure any one of such a notion. The
Italians were forced to start this campaign
under every strategic disadvantage. By the
frontier delimited in 1866, they were left without
natural defenses on the north and east.
All along the Austrian boundary the heights
remained in the hands of the Hapsburgs as
natural menaces to Venetia and Lombardy.
Italy received the plains, but Austria held the
mountain fastnesses that hung above them.</p>

<p>This is so much the case that when Italy declared
war, the Austrian general orders reminded
the troops that they were in the position
of men on the top floor of a six-story
house, defending it from attackers who must
mount from the street under a plunging fire.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Chasseurs
Alpins
in the
Vosges.</div>

<p>But in one way or another the Italians have
been doggedly fighting their way up the walls
of the house. For one thing, their Alpini have
brought to great perfection the use of skis in
military operations on the snow-clad slopes.
This is the first war in which skis have really
come to the front. In France, too, the Chasseurs
Alpins have been able to show the Germans
some astonishing things with their long
wooden snow-shoes in the winter fighting
among the crests of the Vosges.</p>

<p>A typical instance of this is the story of
the capture of a German post on the Alsatian
frontier in the winter of 1914-15. The Germans,
holding the railroad from Ste. Marie to
Ste. Croix, were expecting an attack from the
French position at St. Di&eacute;. This impression
was deliberately strengthened by a heavy artillery
fire from St. Di&eacute;, while a considerable
detachment of the Chasseurs Alpins led a
body of infantry along a winding mountain
road to the village of Bonhomme. There they
posted themselves just out of sight of the German
lines, while the <i>chasseurs</i> scaled the snow-covered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
heights and crept along the flank of
the German position.</p>

<p>When they had reached the desired position,
the infantry charged along the road and the
Chasseurs Alpins simultaneously whizzed down
the slope on their skis. The swift flank attack
did the business, and the Germans were driven
for some miles down the valley of the Weiss
toward Colmar.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Austrians
capture
of Mt.
L&ouml;vchen.</div>

<p>One of the greatest single mountain successes
of the war was the Austrian capture
of Mount L&ouml;vchen, the huge black mass of
rock, nearly six thousand feet high, which
dominates the Austrian port of Cattaro and
sentinels the little kingdom of Montenegro on
the west.</p>

<p>Ever since the war began the Austrians have
from time to time made attempts to reach the
summit of this mighty rock. It is only a
matter of an hour or two by winding road in
peace times, but the Austrians were something
like eighteen months on the job; and in all
this time it is doubtful if the defenders ever
numbered much more than five thousand. It
was not captured until the Montenegrins had
practically run out of ammunition and of reasons
for holding the position. The rest of
their kingdom was overrun, and they were to
all intents and purposes out of the war.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Russians
in the
Carpathians.</div>

<p>The Russian campaign in the Carpathians,
before the great German drive of a year ago
pushed the Czar's armies back into their own
country, also illustrates how the mountain warfare
of to-day grew by natural tendencies from
the tactics of Bourcet into the trench warfare
of northern France.</p>

<p>In the first weeks of the war, when the great
offensive movement of the Austrian army toward
Lublin was crushed by the Grand Duke
Nicholas, and the broken hosts of the Dual
Monarchy were sent flying through Galicia and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
the Carpathians, a cloud of Cossack cavalry
followed them and penetrated into the plains
of Hungary. This last operation was merely
a raid, however, and the Cossacks were soon
galloping back through the mountain passes.</p>

<p>Then the Russians laid siege to Przemysl,
and occupied the whole of Galicia up to the
line of the San. Later they pushed on westward
to the Dunajec, threatening Cracow.
This was their high tide. On their left flank
was the mass of the Carpathians, pierced by
a number of passes. The more important of
these, from west to east, are the Tarnow,
Dukla, Lupkow, and Uzsok.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Carpathian
passes.</div>

<p>The Austrians were rallied after some weeks,
and put up something of a fight for these "contracted
places." The Russians, following the
precepts of Bourcet, threatened the passage
which seemed most desirable, because of the
railroad facilities, and delivered a heavy blow
at the Dukla Pass, the least important of the
four. Here they pushed through to Bartfeld,
on the Hungarian plain. Then, however,
Mackensen's fearful blow smashed the Russian
line on the Dunajec and poured the German
legions across Galicia in the rear of the Carpathian
armies, forcing the Muscovites to abandon
the passes and scurry home.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Plains

<p>Mountain warfare has always had a certain
romantic glamour, and it has filled many pages
in the literature of fighting. As a matter of
historical fact, however, it has played a comparatively
small part in the world's annals.
Almost all the great campaigns have been
fought out in the lowlands. It is Belgium,
for instance, and not Switzerland, that has
been proverbially the battle-ground of Europe.
Napoleon and Suwaroff marched armies
through the Alps, but only as a means of striking
unexpectedly at the enemy who occupied
the plains beyond.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span></p>

<p>Up to the time of the present war, mountain
campaigns have usually been no more than
picturesque foot-notes to history, illuminated
by the valor of raiding clansmen like Roderick
Dhu of the Scottish Highlands, or guerrilla
chiefs like Andreas Hofer, the Tyrolese patriot.
Hofer's struggle against Napoleon was indeed
a gallant and notable one, but it scarcely entered
into the main current of history.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Garibaldi's
mountain
campaigns.</div>

<p>If, however, we include Garibaldi among the
mountain fighters&mdash;and such was the characteristic
bent of his remarkable military genius&mdash;we
must accord him a place among the
molders of modern Europe, for without his
flashing sword Italy could not have been liberated
and united. His two Alpine campaigns
against the Austrians were successful and effective,
but his most brilliant powers were shown
in his memorable invasion of Sicily in 1860.
Chased ashore at Marsala by the Neapolitan
war-ships, and narrowly escaping capture, he
led his followers&mdash;one thousand red-shirted
volunteers armed with obsolete muskets&mdash;into
the Sicilian mountains, where he played such
a game that within two months he compelled
the surrender of a well-equipped army of nearly
thirty thousand regulars. The history of warfare
can show but few exploits so daring and
so dramatic.</p>

<p>The most important military movement on
the western front in the early autumn of 1915
was the great French offensive in Champagne.
During the preceding months of the spring and
summer, there had been hard fighting all along
the 400-mile line from the North Sea to Switzerland.
The military results had been small on
either side and now the French resolved on a
mighty offensive which should be decisive in
its accomplishments. What these results actually
were is told in the following narrative.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span></p>

<h2>THE GREAT CHAMPAGNE<br />
OFFENSIVE OF 1915</h2>

<h3>OFFICIAL ACCOUNT OF THE FRENCH
HEADQUARTERS STAFF</h3>


<div class="sidenote">Menace
of the
French in
Alsace.</div>

<p>After the battles of May and June, 1915,
in Artois, activity on the Western front
became concentrated in the Vosges,
where, by a series of successful engagements,
we managed to secure possession of more favorable
positions and to retain them in spite of incessant
counter-attacks. The superiority established
over the adversary, the wearing down
of the latter through vain and costly counter-offensives,
which absorbed in that sector his
local resources; the state of uncertainty in
which the Germans found themselves in view
of the menace of a French division in Alsace&mdash;such
were the immediate results of these engagements.
From the number of the effectives engaged,
and the limited front along which the
attacks took place, those attacks nevertheless
were no more than local.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Preparing
for a
great
offensive.</div>

<p>While those operations were developing, the
higher command was carefully preparing for a
great offensive. The situation of the Russian
armies imposed on us, as their Allies, obligations
the accomplishment of which had been
made possible by the results of a long course
of preparation no less than by the aid of circumstances.</p>


<div class="sidenote">Improved
defensive
organizations.</div>

<p>The inaction of the adversary, engaged on
the Eastern front in a series of operations of
which he had not foreseen the difficulties, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
thus reduced to the defensive on our front, left
the initiative of the operations in our hands.
The landing in France of fresh British troops
enabled Marshal French to take upon himself
the defence of a portion of the lines hitherto
held by French troops. The improvement of
our defensive organizations, which made possible
certain economies in the effectives, the
regrouping of units and the creation of new
units, also had the effect of placing a larger
number of men at the disposal of the Generalissimo.
The increased output of war <i>mat&eacute;riel</i>
ensured him the necessary means for a complete
artillery preparation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Joffre's
appeal to
the troops.</div>

<p>Among all the elements of success which were
thus united at the end of the summer of 1915,
not the least was the incomparable individual
worth of the French soldier. It was to the
traditional warlike qualities of the race that
the Generalissimo appealed when, on September
23, 1915, he addressed to the troops the
following general order, which was read to the
regiments by their officers:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><div class='center'>"<span class="smcap">Soldiers of the Republic</span></div>

<p>"After months of waiting, which have enabled
us to increase our forces and our resources,
while the adversary has been using up his own,
the hour has come to attack and conquer and
to add fresh glorious pages to those of the
Marne and Flanders, the Vosges and Arras.</p>

<p>"Behind the whirlwind of iron and fire let
loose, thanks to the factories of France, where
your brothers have, night and day, worked for
us, you will proceed to the attack, all together,
on the whole front, in close union with the
armies of our Allies.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
spirit
of the
soldier.</div>

<p>"Your <i>&eacute;lan</i> will be irresistible. It will carry
you at a bound up to the batteries of the adversary,
beyond the fortified lines which he has
placed before you.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span></p>

<p>"You will give him neither pause nor rest
until victory has been achieved.</p>

<p>"Set to with all your might for the deliverance
of the soil of la Patrie, for the triumph
of justice and liberty.</p>

<div class='sig'>
"<span class="smcap">J. Joffre.</span>"<br />
</div></div>

<p>The description of the operations in Champagne
will show under what conditions our
troops acquitted themselves of the task assigned
to them, and also the value and significance
of this success, without precedent in
the war of positions in which we are at present
engaged.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
German
line that
was
broken.</div>

<p>The German line that was broken in Champagne
is the same that was fortified by our
adversaries after the victory of the Marne. It
rests on the western side on the Massif de
Moronvillers; to the east it stretches as far as
the Argonne. It was intended to cover the
railway line from Challerange to Bazancourt,
a line indispensable for the concentration
movements of the German troops. The offensive
front, which extended from Auberive
to the east of Ville-sur-Tourbe, presents a
varied aspect. From east to west may be
seen:</p>

<div class="sidenote">A wooded
glacis.</div>

<p>(1) A glacis about eight kilometres in width,
the gentle slopes of which are covered by
numerous little woods. The road from Saint-Hilaire
to Saint-Souplet, with the Baraque de
l'Epine de Vedegrange, marks approximately
its axis.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Valley of
Souain.</div>

<p>(2) The hollow, at the bottom of which is
the village of Souain and of which the first
German line followed the further edge. The
road from Souain to Pomme-Py describes the
radius of this semi-circle. The farm of Navarin,
at a distance of three and a half kilometres to
the north of Souain, stands on the top of the
hills.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Second
German
line.</div>

<p>(3) To the north of Perthes a comparatively
tranquil region of uniform aspect, forming
between the wooded hills of the Trou Bricot
and those of the Butte du Mesnil a passage
three kilometres wide, barred by several lines
of trenches and ending at a series of heights,
the Butte de Souain, Hills 195 and 201, and
the Butte de Tahure, surmounted by the second
German line.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A strong
German
position.</div>

<p>(4) To the north of Le Mesnil, a very strong
position, bastioned on the west by two twin
heights (Mamelle Nord and Trap&egrave;ze), on the
east by the Butte du Mesnil. The German
trenches formed between these two bastions a
powerful curtain, behind which extended as
far as Tahure a thickly wooded, undulating
region.</p>

<p>(5) To the north of Beaus&eacute;jour a bare terrain
easily practicable, with a gentle rise in
the direction of Ripon as far as the farm of
Maisons de Champagne.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Eastern
flank
of the
German
line.</div>

<p>(6) To the north of Massiges, Hills numbered
191 and 199, describing on the map the
figure of a hand, very strongly constructed and
constituting the eastern flank of the whole
German line. This tableland slopes down
gently in the direction of Ville-sur-Tourbe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">German
system
of trench
defenses.</div>

<p>The achievements of our troops from September
25 to October 3, 1915, in this region
may be thus summarised: They scaled the
whole of the glacis of l'Epine de Vedegrange;
they occupied the ridge of the hollow at
Souain; debouched in the opening to the
north of Perthes to the slopes of Hill 195 and
as far as the Butte de Tahure; carried the
western bastions of the curtain of le Mesnil;
advanced as far as Maisons de Champagne and
took by assault the "hand" of Massiges. That
is to say that they captured an area about
forty square kilometres in extent. The importance
of that figure is shown when one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
examines on the map accompanying this report
the position of the German trenches, with a
view to understanding the system of defence
adopted by our adversaries. Two positions,
distant from three to four kilometres from
each other, stand out clearly. The first is the
more dense; the trenches with their alleys of
communication present at certain points the
appearance of a wirework chessboard. Everywhere,
to a depth of from 300 to 400 metres
there are at least three parallel lines, sometimes
five. The trenches are separated from
each other as a rule by wire entanglements
varying in width from 15 to 60 metres.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
second
position.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Alleys of
communication.</div>

<p>The second position comprises only one
trench, reinforced at certain points by a supporting
trench. It is everywhere constructed,
as is the wire network in front of it, in the
form of a slope. On top there are merely observation
stations with machine-gun shelters
connected with the trench by an alley of communication.
Between the two positions the
terrain was also specially prepared, being cut
up by transverse or diagonal trenches. The
alleys of communication constructed to facilitate
the firing, which were in many cases
protected by wirework, make possible, according
to the German method, a splitting up of
the terrain by lateral fire and the maintenance,
even after the tide of the assailants had flooded
the trenches, of centres of resistance, veritable
strongholds that could only be reduced after a
siege. The positions of the artillery were
established, as were also the camps and provision
depots, behind the first position, the principal
line of defence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">German
organization
known.</div>

<p>The whole German organization was known
to us. It was shown on our maps, and every
defensive work, trench, alley of communication,
and clump of trees was given a special name
or a number preceded by a certain letter, according<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
to the sector of attack wherein it was
situated. This minute precision in the details
of the preparation is worthy of being pointed
out; it constitutes one of the peculiarities of
the present war, a veritable siege war, in which
the objective has to be realised beforehand
and clearly determined, every piece of ground
having to be captured by heavy fighting, as was
formerly every redan and every curtain.</p>

<p>The bombardment of the German positions
began on September 22, 1915 and was pursued
night and day according to a time scheme and
a division of labour previously determined
upon. The results expected were:</p>

<div class="sidenote">Results of
bombardment.</div>

<p>(1) The destruction of the wire entanglements.</p>

<p>(2) The burial of the defenders in their dug-out.</p>

<p>(3) The razing of the trenches and the
demolition of the embrasures.</p>

<p>(4) The stopping-up of the alleys of communication.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Work
of the
long-range
guns.</div>

<p>The gun-fire covered not only the first trench
but also the supporting trench and even the
second position, although the distance at which
the last was situated and the outline of its
wire entanglements made it difficult to make
field observations in that direction. At the
same time the heavy long-range guns bombarded
the headquarters, the cantonments and
the railway stations; they cut the railway lines,
causing a suspension of the work of revictualling.
The best witnesses to the effectiveness
of our bombardment are to be found
in unfinished letters found upon prisoners.</p>

"<span class="smcap">September 25.</span><br />
</div>

<p>"We have passed through some terrible
hours. It was as though the whole world was
in a state of collapse. We have had heavy
losses. One company of two hundred and fifty
men had sixty killed last night. A neighboring
battery had sixteen killed yesterday.</p>

<p>Report made on September 24 in the morning,
by the captain commanding the 3rd company
of the 135th Regiment of Reserve:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The French are firing on us with great
bombs and machine-guns. We must have reinforcements
at once. Many men are no longer
fit for anything. It is not that they are
wounded, but they are Landsturmers. Moreover

announced.</p>

<p>"Send rations immediately; no food has

<p>"I urgently beg for reinforcements; the men

<p>The time fixed for all the attacks on the
Champagne front was a quarter-past nine in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
the morning. There was no hesitation. At
the time mentioned the troops came out of
the trenches with the aid of steps or scaling
ladders and drew up in line before making a
rush at the German trenches.</p>

<p>The operation was rapidly effected. The
objective was at an average distance of two
hundred metres; this was covered without
serious losses. The Germans were nearly
everywhere surprised, and their defensive fire
was not opened until after the invading tide
of the attackers had passed by.</p>

<div class="sidenote">First
German
trench
penetrated.</div>

<p>Over the whole attacking front our troops
penetrated into the first German trench. But
subsequently the progress was no longer uniform.
While certain units continued their forward
movement with extreme rapidity, others
came up against machine guns still in action
and either stopped or advanced only with difficulty.
Some centres of the German resistance
maintained their position for several
hours and even for several days.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Outline of

Champagne.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The battle
a series of
assaults.</div>

<p>A line showing the different stages of our
advance in Champagne would assume a curiously
winding outline, and would reveal on
the one hand the defensive power of an adversary
resolved to stick to the ground at all
costs and on the other the victorious continuity
of the efforts of our troops in this hand-to-hand
struggle. The battle of Champagne must
be considered in the light of a series of assaults,
executed at the same moment, in
parallel or convergent directions and having
for their object either the capture or the hemming
in of the first German position, the units
being instructed to reform in a continuous line
before the second position.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Unity
of the
action.</div>

<p>In order to understand the development, the
terrain must be divided into several sectors,
in each of which the operations, although
closely co-ordinated, assumed, as a consequence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
either of the nature of the ground or
of the peculiarities of the enemy defences, a
different character. The unity of the action
was nevertheless ensured by the simultaneity
of the rush, which carried all the troops beyond
the first position, past the batteries, to
the defences established by the enemy on the
heights to the south of Py.</p>

<div class="sidenote">At extremities

progress.</div>

<p>At the two extremities of our attacking
front, subjected to converging fires and to
counter-attacks on the flanks, our offensive
made no progress. The fighting which took
place in Auberive and round about Servon
were distinguished by more than one trait of
heroism, but they were destined to have no
other result than that of containing the forces
of the enemy and of immobilising him at the
wings while the attack was progressing in the
centre.</p>

first German line was established at the base
of a wide glacis covered with clumps of trees,
and formed a series of salients running into
each other. At certain points it ran along
the edge of the woods where the supplementary
defences were completed by abattis. The position
as a whole between Auberive and Souain
described a vast triangle. To the west of the
road, from Saint-Hilaire to Saint-Souplet, the
troops traversed the first enemy line and
rushed forward for a distance of about a kilometre
as far as a supporting trench, in front
of which they were stopped by the wirework.

caused a slight retirement of our left. The
troops of the right, on the contrary, maintained
their gains and succeeded on the following
days in enlarging and extending them,
remaining in touch with the units which were
attacking on the east of the road. The latter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
had succeeded in a particularly brilliant manner
in overcoming the difficulties with which
they were confronted.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Nature
of the
position
captured.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Prisoners
and guns
seized.</div>

<p>The German position which they captured,
with its triple and quadruple lines of trenches,
its small forts armed with machine guns, its
woods adapted for the purpose in view, constituted
one of the most complete schemes of
defence on the Champagne front and afforded
cover to a numerous artillery concealed in the
woods of the glacis. On this front, which was
about three and a half kilometres wide, the attack
on September 25, 1915 achieved a varying
success. The troops on the left, after having
penetrated into the first trench, had their
progress arrested by machine guns. On the
right, however, in spite of the obstacle presented
by four successive trenches, each of which was
covered by a network of wire entanglements
and was concealed in the woods, where our artillery
had difficulty in reaching them, the attacking
troops gained nearly two kilometres,
capturing seven hundred prisoners, of whom
seventeen were officers, and seizing two guns of
77 and five guns of 105.</p>

<p>The advance recommenced on September 27,
1915. The left took possession of the woods
lining the road from Saint-Hilaire to Saint-Souplet
as far as the Epine de Vedegrange.
Along the whole extent of the wooded heights as
far as the western side of the hollow at Souain
the success was identical. Notwithstanding
the losses they sustained, notwithstanding the
fatigue involved in the incessant fighting, the
troops pushed forward, leaving behind them
only a sufficient force to clear the woods of
isolated groups of the enemy who still remained
there. Between 4 and 6 p.m. we arrived
immediately in front of the second German
position.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Second

<div class="sidenote">Results of

in this
sector.</div>

<p>On the 27th we penetrated into this position<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
at two points. We took possession of a trench
about a kilometre wide, called the "parallel of
the Epine de Vedegrange," which is duplicated
almost throughout by another trench (the
parallel of the wood of Chevron), and the
wirework entanglements of which were intact,
and precluded an assault. Further east our
soldiers also continued, thanks to the conformation
of the terrain, to penetrate into the
enemy trench to a depth of about four hundred
metres. But it was impossible to take advantage
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'to'">of</ins> this breach owing to a concentration
of the German heavy artillery, a rapidly
continued defence of the surrounding woods,
and the fire of machine guns which it was not
possible to capture and which were directed
from the trenches on the right and left of the
entry and exit to the breach. The results attained
in this attacking sector alone may be
stated thus: fifteen square miles of territory
organized for defence throughout nearly the
whole of its extent; on September 28, forty-four
cannon, seven of 105 and six of 150, and
more than three thousand prisoners.</p>

<p>(2) <i>Sector of Souain.</i> The enemy lines
round about Souain described a wide curve.
In the immediate vicinity of our trenches, to
the west at the Mill and to the east of the
wood of Sabot, they swerved to the extent of
over a kilometre to the north of the village
and of the source of the Ain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sapping
operations.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Assault
made in
three
directions.</div>

<p>When the offensive was decided upon it was
necessary, in order to extend our lines forward
to striking distance, to undertake sapping
operations in parallel lines, and at times to
make dashes by night over the intervening
ground. The men working underground got
into communication with the trenches by digging
alleys of communication. This difficult
undertaking was effected with very slight
losses, under the eyes and under the fire of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
enemy. Our parallel lines approached to within
a distance of two hundred metres of the
German trenches. The assault was made in
three different directions: on the west in the
direction of Hills 167 and 174; in the centre
along a line running parallel with the road
from Souain to Pomme-Py, in the direction of
the farm of Navarin; on the east in the direction
of the woods intersected by the road from
Souain to Tahure, and in the direction of the
Butte de Souain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Machine
gun positions
surrounded.</div>

<p>The advance was extremely rapid&mdash;on the
left two kilometres in less than one hour, in
the centre three kilometres in forty-five minutes.
At 10 a.m. we had reached the farm of
Navarin. Towards the east the forward march
was more difficult. Some German machine
guns stood their ground in the wood of Sabot
and contributed to the resistance of the enemy.
This defence was destined to be overcome by
surrounding them. Arriving at the wooded
region in that part where it is intersected by
the road from Souain to Tahure, the assailants
joined up on September 27, 1915 with
those of our troops who were attacking to the
north of Perthes. They left behind them only
what was barely necessary in the way of troops
to clear the woods of stragglers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
French
take guns
and supplies.</div>

<p>Parlementaires were sent to the Germans,
who received them with a volley of rifle shots
and endeavored to escape during the night.
The majority were killed and the survivors
surrendered. Several batteries and a large
quantity of <i>mat&eacute;riel</i> (supplies of shells and
provisions, grenades, telephones, wire, light
railways) remained in our hands. On the
28th, along the entire length of the sector, we
were immediately in front of the second German
position. The troops had shown an unparalleled
ardour and energy. They had been
trained by officers whose courage and spirit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
of self-sacrifice are indicated by this casualty
list; a general of division and four colonels
wounded; two colonels killed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Wooded
region
between
Souain
and
Perthes.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Region
broken
up by
mines and
trenches.</div>

<p>(3) <i>Sector of Perthes.</i> Between Souain and
Perthes stretches a wooded region in which
already, in February and March, heavy fighting
had taken place. At that period we had
contrived to take possession on the eastern extremity
of this region of the German defences
of the wood of Sabot. We had also made
progress to the north-west of Perthes, on the
summit of Hill 200. But between these two
positions the Germans had retained a strong
system of trenches forming a salient almost
triangular in shape, to which we gave the
name of the Pocket (<i>la Poche</i>). During the
whole year a war of mining had been going on,
and the region, which was broken up by concave
constructions and intersected in all directions
by trenches and alleys of communication,
constituted an attacking ground all the
more difficult because to the north of la Poche
the somewhat thickly wooded Trou Bricot, the
edges of which were in a state of defence, obstructed
a rapid advance. This wooded region
extends over a width of a kilometre and a half
and a depth of four kilometres. The arrangements
made for the attack contemplated, after
the capture of la Poche, the surrounding of
the wood of the Trou Bricot. The junction
was to be made at the road from Souain to
Tahure, with the troops assigned for the attack
on the eastern border of the hollow at
Souain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The York
trench.</div>

<p>The ground to the east of the Trou Bricot
was less difficult. Open and comparatively
flat, it was defended on the north of Perthes
by a triple line of trenches distant 100 metres
from each other. At a distance of 1000 metres
to 1200 metres a supporting trench, called the
"York trench," was almost unique in its entire<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
construction. The open country beyond
stretched for a distance of three kilometres
up to the second German position (Hill 195,
Butte de Tahure). The principal effort was
directed against this passage, the left flank of
the attack being secured by a subsidiary action
confined to the capture of la Poche.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Attack
preceded
by artillery
fire.</div>

<p>At 9 a.m. our artillery directed its fire successively
against the first-line trenches and the
supporting trenches. The attack took place in
the most perfect order. The assailants were
already swarming in the German lines when
the enemy artillery opened its defensive fire.
Our counter-batteries hampered the German
pieces and our reserves in the rear suffered
little from their fire.</p>

<div class="sidenote">La Poche
position
surrendered.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The York
trench
occupied.</div>

<p>At 9.45 a.m. the two columns which were
attacking the extremities of the salient of la
Poche joined hands. The position was surrounded.
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'These'">Those</ins> Germans who remained alive
inside it surrendered. At the same time a battalion
was setting foot in the defences of the
southern edges of the wood of Trou Bricot.
The battalions that followed, marching to the
outside of the eastern edges, executed with perfect
regularity a "left turn" and came and
formed up alongside the alleys of communication
as far as the supporting trench. At the
same moment, in the open country to the north
of Perthes, the troops surmounted the three
first-line trenches and, preceded by our artillery,
made a quick march towards the York
trench and occupied it almost without striking
a blow.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cleaning
up the
sector.</div>

<p>Further to the East, along the road from
Perthes to Tahure, their advance encountered
greater difficulties. Some centres of the German
resistance could not be overcome. A
sheltered machine gun continued its fire. An
infantry officer, with a quartermaster of artillery,
succeeded in getting into action a gun<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
at a distance of three hundred metres from the
machine gun and in firing at it at close quarters.
Of the troops which were advancing to
the north of Perthes, some made for the eastern
border of the wood of Bricot, where they
penetrated into the camps, ousting the defenders
and surprising several officers in bed. Late
in the afternoon one of our regiments had
reached the road from Souain to Tahure.
Other units were marching straight towards
the north, clearing out the little woods on the
way. They there captured batteries of which
the artillerymen were riveted to their guns by
means of bayonets (notably ten pieces of 105
and five of 150).</p>

<div class="sidenote">Progress
hindered
by
weather.</div>

<p>The same work was being performed in the
woods extending east of the road from Perthes
to Souain and Tahure, where batteries were
charged and captured while in action. At this
spot a regiment covered four kilometres in two
hours and captured ten guns, three of 105 and
seven of 77. But, from twelve o'clock midday
onwards the rate of progress decreased, the
bad weather making it impossible for our artillery
to see what was going on, and rendering
the joining up of the different corps extremely
difficult. From the Buttes de Souain and
Tahure the enemy directed converging fires on
our men, who were advancing along very open
ground. Nevertheless they continued their advance
as far as the slopes of Hill 193 and the
Butte de Tahure, and there dug themselves in.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Contact
with
second
German
position.</div>

<p>The night passed without any counter-attack
by the enemy. Our artillery, including several
field batteries, which had arrived immediately
after the attack beyond the York trench, also
brought forward its heavy pieces. At dawn the
reconstituted regiments made another forward
rush which enabled them to establish themselves
in immediate contact with the second
German position from the Butte de Souain to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
the Butte de Tahure, and even to seize several
advanced posts in that neighbourhood.</p>

<p>But on the lower slopes some of the wire entanglements
remained intact; a successful
assault on them would have been possible only
after a fresh preparation. Up to October 6,
1915, the troops remained where they were,
digging trenches and organizing a defensive
system which had to be constructed all over
again on ground devastated by the enemy fire.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ravin des
Cuisines.</div>

<p>(4) <i>Sector of Le Mesnil.</i> It was to the north
of Le Mesnil that we encountered the greatest
resistance on the part of the adversary. In
the course of the engagements of the preceding
winter we had succeeded in securing a foothold
on top of the hill numbered 196. The Germans
remained a little to the east, in a ravine which
we continued to call by its designation of the
"Ravine of the Kitchens" (Ravin des Cuisines).
Our assault rendered us masters of it, but we
could make no further progress.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fighting
on the
Butte du
Mesnil.</div>

<p>The German trenches are constructed on the
northern slopes of Hill 196, and are concealed
from field observation so that it is difficult for
the artillery to play upon them. Moreover,
they are flanked on one side by the twin heights
of the Mamelles, on the other by the Butte du
Mesnil. To the eastward some of our units contrived
on September 25, 1915, to penetrate into
the trenches of the <i>butte</i> (knoll), but failed
to maintain their ground, in consequence of a
counter-attack supported by flank fires. Westward,
it was not until the night of the 1st to
the 2nd of October, 1915, that we captured the
northern Mamelle, thus surrounding the works
of the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Trapeze'">Trap&egrave;ze</ins> which surmount the southern
Mamelle.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rapid and
brilliant
advance.</div>

<p>(5) <i>Sector of Beaus&eacute;jour.</i> The attacks
launched north of Beaus&eacute;jour met with a more
rapid and more brilliant success. The swarm
of invaders throwing themselves on the first<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
German lines captured one after the other the
enemy works in the very sparsely timbered
woods called the Fer de Lance wood and the
Demi-Lune wood, and afterwards all the works
known as the Bastion. In one rush certain
units gained the top of Maisons de Champagne,
past several batteries, killing the artillerymen
as they served their pieces. The same movement
took the assailants across the intricate
region of the mine "funnels" of Beaus&eacute;jour up
to the extended wood intersected by the road
to Maisons de Champagne. Our soldiers then
came across German artillerymen engaged in
unlimbering their guns. They killed the
drivers and horses; the survivors surrendered.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cavalry
supports
the
infantry.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Enemy
counter-attacks.</div>

<p>Further westward the left wing of the attacking
troops advanced with greater difficulty,
being hampered by small forts and covered
works with which the trenches were everywhere
protected. It was at this moment that
the cavalry came unexpectedly to the support
of the infantry. Two squadrons of hussars
having crossed our old trenches in face of a
heavy defensive artillery fire prepared to gallop
against the German batteries north of Maisons
de Champagne, when they reached that part
of the lines where the Germans still maintained
their position. The latter immediately directed
the fire of their machine guns against the
cavalrymen, several of whose horses were hit.
The hussars dismounted and, with drawn
sabres, made for the trenches, while favoured
by this diversion, the infantrymen resumed
their forward movement. The resistance of
the enemy broke down; more than six hundred
Germans were captured in this way. In the
course of the afternoon and during the day of
September 25, 1915, some enemy counter-attacks
were made from the direction of Ripont,
but were unsuccessful in ousting us from <ins title="Transcriber's Note: this word not present in original text">the</ins>
summit of Maisons de Champagne.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span></p>

<p>On the following days a fierce struggle took
place north of the summit in the region of a
defensive work known as the "Ouvrage de la
D&eacute;faite," which was captured by us, lost, then
recaptured, and finally evacuated in consequence
of an extremely violent bombardment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Heights
of
Massiges.</div>

<p>(6) <i>Sector of Massiges.</i> The safety of our
troops which had advanced as far as the extended
wood and Maisons de Champagne was
assured by the capture of the summits of the
heights of Massiges. This sharply undulating
upland, numbered 199 on the north and 191 on
the south, constituted in the hands of the
Germans a fortress which they believed to be
impregnable and from the top of which they
commanded our positions in several directions.
At 9.15 a.m. the two first attacking parties
marched out in columns. The men went forth
gaily and deliberately, preceded by the firing
of the field artillery. By 9.30 a.m. our infantry,
before the enemy had had time to recover
themselves, had reached the summit.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Enemy
machine
gun fire.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Lines of
grenadiers.</div>

<p>From this moment, subject to machine gun
and musketry fire, the men could only proceed
slowly along the summits by the alleys of communication,
with hand grenades, supported by
the artillery, with whom they remained in
constant touch by flag-signalling. As the advance
of our grenadiers continued, the Germans
surrendered in large numbers. An uninterrupted
chain of grenade-bearers, like the chains
of bucket-holders at a fire in former times,
was established in the alleys of communication
from Massiges forward, and each fresh arrival
of grenades was accompanied by a fresh
advance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Value of
possessing
the
heights.</div>

<p>From September 25 to October 3, 1915, the
fight continued in this way and was carried
on by our soldiers with fierce persistency. The
Germans hurled upon the spot constant reinforcements<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
and offered an obstinate resistance
that has rarely been equalled. They stood up
to be shot down&mdash;the machine-gun men at their
guns, the grenadiers on their grenade chests.
All attempts at a counter-attack remained
equally unproductive. The possession of the
heights of Massiges enabled us to extend our
gains towards Ville-sur-Tourbe, while taking in
flank the trenches which we had failed to
secure by a frontal attack.</p>

<p>The loss of the heights of Massiges appears
to have particularly upset the German General
Staff, which, after having denied the fact,
represented that the ground which it had lost
as a consequence of grenade fighting had been
abandoned owing to artillery fire.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Attitude
of the
enemy.</div>

<p>The attitude of the enemy was characterized
by: (1) Surprise; (2) disorganization; (3) a
sudden and almost disorderly engagement of
the reserves; (4) the exhaustion and demoralization
of the soldiers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Reasons
for surprise.</div>

<p>(1) It is beyond doubt that the Germans
were surprised by the extent and violence of
our attacks. They were expecting a French
offensive. The orders of the day of Generals
von Fleck and Von Ditfurth prove this. ("The
possibility of a great French offensive must be
considered": Von Ditfurth, August 15. "The
French Higher Command appears to be disposed
to make another desperate effort": Von
Fleck, September 26.) But the Germans foresaw
neither the strength nor the success of
the effort. During our artillery preparation
twenty-nine battalions only were brought back
to Champagne (the 183rd Brigade, the 5th
Division of the 3rd Corps, and one-half of the
43rd Division of Reserve). In thus limiting
before the attack the reinforcements of its effectives
the German General Staff showed that
they did not suspect the vigour of the blow that
was about to be delivered.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span></p>

<p>The same thing happened with regard to the
subordinate forces. Inside the shelters in the
second line officers were captured while lying
down; they had an unwarranted confidence in
the strength of their first line, and the interruption
of telephone communications had prevented
their being informed of the rapid progress
of our offensive.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rapidity
of French
attack.</div>

<p>(2) This rapidity of our attack explains the
disorganization of the adversary on the morning
of September 25. At some points certain
officers and non-commissioned officers were
able to continue the resistance until the investment,
followed by capitulation. But elsewhere
there were prompt surrenders. Men were also
seen flying before our attacking troops and
being killed while making for their second
position.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How the
German
reserves
were
utilized.</div>

<p>(3) In order to make up for the insufficiency
of the local reserves the German military
authorities had to put in line not only the
important units which they held at their disposal
behind the front (10th Corps brought
back from Russia), but the local reserves from
other sectors (Soissonnais, Argonne, Woevre,
Alsace), which were despatched to Champagne
one battalion after another, and even in groups
of double companies.</p>

<p>Nothing better indicates the disorganization
of the German command and the significance
of the check suffered than the conditions under
which these reserves were engaged.</p>

<p>The units were despatched to the fight completely
disassociated. Among the regiments of
the 5th Division (3rd Corps), one, the 81st,
was identified near Massiges, while a battalion
of the 12th was at Tahure and a battalion of
the 32nd at the Trou Bricot. It was the same
as regards the 56th Division, of which the 88th
and 35th Regiments were despatched to Massiges
and the 91st to Souain, while a battalion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
of the 79th took up a position to the west of
the Butte de Tahure.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Haste
increased
German
losses.</div>

<p>Ill provided with food and munitions, the
reinforcements were thrown into the engagement
on an unknown terrain without indication
as to the direction they had to take and without
their junction with neighbouring units having
been arranged. Through the haste with
which they threw their reserves under the fire
of our artillery and of our infantry, already in
possession of the positions, the German General
Staff considerably increased the number of
their losses.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Soldiers
brought
by
motor-car.</div>

<p>A letter taken from a soldier of the 118th
Regiment furnishes us with proof of this:
"We were put in a motor-car and proceeded at
a headlong pace to Tahure, by way of Vouziers.
Two hours' rest in the open air, with rain
falling and then we had a six hours' march to
take up our positions. On our way we were
greeted by the fire of the enemy shells, so that,
for instance, out of 280 men of the second
company, only 224 <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'arrival'">arrived</ins> safe and sound inside
the trenches. These trenches, freshly dug,
were barely from 35 to 50 centimetres deep.
Continually surrounded by mines and bursting
shells, we had to remain in them and do the
best we could with them for 118 hours without
getting anything hot to eat.</p>

<p>"Hell itself could not be more terrible. To-day,
at about twelve o'clock noon, 600 men,
fresh troops, joined the regiment. In five days
we have lost as many and more."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Battalions
from
many
regiments.</div>

<p>The disorder amid which the reinforcements
were engaged appears clearly from this fact,
that on the only part of the front included
between Maisons de Champagne and Hill 189
there were on October 2, 1915, thirty-two
battalions belonging to twenty-one different
regiments.</p>

<p>(4) The violence of the shock sustained, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
the necessity of replacing in the fighting line
units which had almost entirely disappeared,
hampered the German military authorities.
On the first day they were unable to respond
effectively even with their artillery, the fire of
which along the whole front was badly directed
and as a rule poorly sustained. The loss of
numerous batteries obviously deprived them of
a portion of their resources.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Enemy endeavors
to stem
advance.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Isolated
battalion
on the
heights
of
Massiges.</div>

<p>The following days the enemy seemed to have
but one idea, to strengthen their second line
to stem our advance. The counter-attacks were
concentrated on a comparatively unimportant
part of the battlefront in certain places, the
loss of which appeared to them to be particularly
dangerous. Therefore on the heights of
Massiges the German military authorities
threw in succession isolated battalions of the
123rd, 124th, and 120th regiments, of the 30th
regular regiment and of the 2nd regiment of
Ersatz Reserve (16th Corps), which were each
in turn decimated, for these counter-attacks,
hastily and crudely prepared, all resulted in
sanguinary failures. Generally speaking, the
offensive capacity of the Germans appeared to
be broken. The following order of the day of
General von Ditfurth bears witness to this:</p>

<div class="sidenote">General
von Ditfurth's
order.</div>

<p>"It seemed to me that the infantry at certain
points was confining its action to a mere
defensive.... I cannot protest too strongly
against such an idea, which necessarily results
in destroying the spirit of offensive in our own
troops and in arousing and strengthening in
the mind of the enemy a feeling of his
superiority.</p>

<p>"The enemy is left full liberty of action and
our own action is subjected to the will of the
enemy."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Prisoners
exhausted.</div>

<p>(5) In an engagement in the open the number
of prisoners is an indication of the spirit
of the enemy. In Champagne the Germans surrendered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
in constituted units (sections or
companies), and even in groups of several
hundred men. They confessed that they were
worn out. They had been, for the most part,
without supplies for several days and had suffered
more particularly from thirst. They all
showed that they had been greatly impressed
by our uninterrupted artillery fire, the feeble
response of their own guns, and the extent of
their losses.</p>

<p>Here by way of specimen is what was set
down by a reserve lieutenant of the 90th Regiment
of infantry (10th Corps):</p>

<p>"Yesterday I had sixteen men killed by high
explosive bombs. The trench was nearly filled
up. Extreme activity of the French howitzers.
Our artillery fires shrapnel, but unfortunately
does not get the range.</p>

<p>"B... was also killed. The second battalion,
too, has had heavy losses. It is frightful.
Those confounded high explosive shells!</p>

<div class="sidenote">An officer
wishes
for rain.</div>

<p>"The weather is becoming fine again. If
only it would rain again, or fog would come.
As it is, the aviators will arrive and we shall
have more high explosive bombs and flank firing
on the trenches. Abominable fine weather!
Fog, fog, come to our assistance."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
enemy's
lines.</div>

<p>It is difficult to estimate precisely the German
losses. Certain indications however serve
to indicate their extent. A <i>vizefeldwebel</i> declares
that he is the only man remaining out
of his company. A soldier of the third battalion
of the 123rd Regiment engaged on the
26th, states that his regiment was withdrawn
from the front after only two days' fighting
because its losses were too great. The 118th
Regiment relieved in the trenches the 158th
Regiment after it had been reduced to fifteen or
twenty men per company. Certain units disappeared
completely, as for instance the 27th
Reserve Regiment and the 52nd Regular Regiment,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
which, by the evening of the 25th had
left in our hands, the first thirteen officers
and 933 men, the second twenty-one officers
and 927 men. In order to arrive at the total
of the losses certain figures may serve as an
indication.</p>

<div class="sidenote">German
strength
in Champagne.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Ninety-three
fresh battalions.</div>

<p>At the beginning of September, 1915 the
Germans had on the Champagne front seventy
battalions. In anticipation of our attack they
brought there, before September 25, 1915,
twenty-nine battalions. This makes ninety-nine
battalions, representing, if account be
taken of the corresponding artillery and
pioneer formations, 115,000 men directly engaged.
The losses due to the artillery preparation
and the first attacks were such that from
September 25 to October 15, 1915, the German
General Staff was compelled to renew its effectives
almost in their entirety by sending
ninety-three fresh battalions.</p>

<p>It may be assumed that the units engaged
on September 25 and 26, 1915, suffered losses
amounting to from 60 to 80 per cent. (even
more for certain corps, which have entirely
disappeared). The new units brought into
line for the counter-attacks, and subjected in
connection with these to an incessant bombardment,
lost 50 per cent. of their effectives,
if not more. We think we shall be understating
the case if we set down 140,000 men as the
sum of the German losses in Champagne. Account
must be taken of the fact that of this
number the proportion of slightly wounded
men able to recuperate rapidly and return to
the front is, in the case of the Germans, very
much below the average proportion in connection
with other engagements by reason of the
fact that they were unable to gather up their
wounded, and thus left in our hands nearly the
whole of the troops entrusted with the defence
of the first position.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Enthusiasm

<p>All those who lived through the engagements
of the battle of Champagne experienced the
sensation of victory. The aspect of the battlefield,
the long columns of prisoners, the look
in the eyes of our soldiers, their animation and
their enthusiasm, all this gave expression to
the importance of a success which the Generalissimo
recognized in these terms.</p>

<p>Of all the brutal atrocities perpetrated by the
Germans in Belgium, none aroused such world-wide
horror and execration as the murder of
Edith Cavell, an English nurse, on the charge
of aiding English and Belgian soldiers who escaped
from Belgium in order to rejoin their

<h2>THE TRAGEDY OF EDITH<br />
CAVELL</h2>

<h3>BRAND WHITLOCK</h3>


<div class="sidenote">The first
letter of
inquiry
not answered.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Reasons
given for
Miss
Cavell's
arrest.</div>

<p>One day in August it was learned at the
Legation that an English nurse, named
Edith Cavell, had been arrested by the
Germans. I wrote a letter to the Baron von
der Lancken to ask if it was true that Miss
Cavell had been arrested, and saying that if
it were I should request that Ma&icirc;tre de Leval,
the legal counselor of the Legation, be permitted
to see her and to prepare for her defense.
There was no reply to this letter, and on September
tenth I wrote a second letter, repeating
the questions and the requests made in the first.
On the twelfth of September I had a reply
from the Baron stating that Miss Cavell had
been arrested on the fifth of August, that she
was confined in the prison of St. Gilles, that
she had admitted having hidden English and
French soldiers in her home, as well as Belgians,
of an age to bear arms, all anxious to
get to the front, that she had admitted also
having furnished these soldiers with money to
get to France, and had provided guides to
enable them to cross the Dutch frontier; that
the defense of Miss Cavell was in the hands of
Ma&icirc;tre Thomas Braun, and that inasmuch as
the German Government, on principle, would
not permit accused persons to have any interviews
whatever, he could not obtain permission
for Ma&icirc;tre de Leval to visit Miss Cavell as long
as she was in solitary confinement.</p>


<div class="sidenote">The
German
mentality.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The
principle
that
power
makes
right.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The
accused
without
rights.</div>

<p>For one of our Anglo-Saxon race and legal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
traditions to understand conditions in Belgium
during the German occupation, it is necessary
to banish resolutely from the mind every
conception of right we have inherited from our
ancestors&mdash;conceptions long since crystallized
into inimitable principles of law and confirmed
in our charters of liberty. In the German
mentality these conceptions do not exist; they
think in other sequences; they act according
to another principle, if it is a principle, the
conviction that there is only one right, one
privilege, and that it belongs exclusively to
Germany, the right, namely, to do whatever
they have the physical force to do. These so-called
courts, of whose arbitrary and irresponsible
and brutal nature I have tried to convey
some notion, were mere inquisitorial bodies,
guided by no principle save that of interest in
their own bloody nature; they did as they
pleased, and would have scorned a Jeffreys as
too lenient, a Lynch as too formal, a Spanish
<i>auto da f&eacute;</i> as too technical, and a tribunal of
the French Revolution as soft and sentimental.
Before them the accused had literally no rights,
not even to present a defense, and if he was
permitted to speak in his own behalf, it was
only as a generous and liberal favor.</p>

<p>It was before such a court that Edith Cavell
was to be arraigned. I had asked Ma&icirc;tre de
Leval to provide for her defense, and on his
advice, inasmuch as Ma&icirc;tre Braun was already
of counsel in the case, chosen by certain friends
of Miss Cavell, I invited him into consultation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Personality
of
Edith
Cavell.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Miss
Cavell's
character
and
ability.</div>

<p>Edith Cavell was a frail and delicate little
woman about forty years of age. She had come
to Brussels some years before the war to exercise
her calling as a trained nurse. She soon
became known to the leading physicians of the
capital and nursed in the homes of the leading
families. But she was ambitious, and devoted
to her profession, and ere long had entered a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
nursing-home in the Rue de la Clinique, where
she organized for Doctor Depage a training-school
for nurses. She was a woman of refinement
and education; she knew French as she
knew her own language; she was deeply religious,
with a conscience almost puritan, and
was very stern with herself in what she conceived
to be her duty. In her training-school
she showed great executive ability, was firm in
matters of discipline, and brought it to a high
state of efficiency. And every one who knew
her in Brussels spoke of her with that unvarying
term of respect which her noble character
inspired.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mr. Whitlock
engages
a
defender.</div>

<p>Some time before the trial, Ma&icirc;tre Thomas
Braun announced to the Legation that for personal
reasons he would be obliged to withdraw
from the case, and asked that some one else
appear for Miss Cavell. We engaged Ma&icirc;tre
Sadi Kirschen.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The court
martial
in the
Senate
chamber.</div>

<p>It was the morning of Thursday, October
seventh, that the case came before the court
martial in the Senate chamber, where the military
trials always took place, and Miss Cavell
was arraigned with the Princess de Croy, the
Countess de Belleville, and thirty-two others.
The accused were seated in a circle facing the
court, in such a way that they could neither
see nor communicate with their own counsel,
who were compelled to sit behind them. Nor
could they see the witnesses, who were also
placed behind them.</p>

<p>The charge brought against the accused was
that of having conspired to violate the German
Military Penal Code, punishing with death
those who conduct troops to the enemy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The trial
secret.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Miss
Cavell's
attitude.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Admits
aiding
English
soldiers.</div>

<p>We have no record of that trial; we do not
know all that occurred there behind the closed
doors of that Senate chamber, where for fourscore
years laws based on another and more
enlightened principle of justice had been discussed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
Miss Cavell did not know, or knew
only in the vaguest manner, the offense with
which she was charged. She did not deny
having received at her hospital English soldiers
whom she nursed and to whom she gave money;
she did not deny that she knew they were going
to try to cross the border into Holland. She
even took a patriotic pride in the fact. She
was very calm. She was interrogated in German,
a language she did not understand, but
the questions and responses were translated
into French. Her mind was very alert, and she
was entirely self-possessed, and frequently
rectified any inexact details and statements
that were put to her. When, in her interrogatory,
she was asked if she had not aided
English soldiers left behind after the early
battles of the preceding Autumn about Mons
and Charleroi, she said yes; they were English
and she was English, and she would help her
own. The answer seemed to impress the court.
They asked her if she had not helped twenty.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said "more than twenty; two
hundred."</p>

<p>"English?"</p>

<p>"No, not all English; French and Belgians,
too."</p>

<p>But the French and Belgians were not of her
own nationality, said the judge&mdash;and that made
a serious difference. She was subjected to a
nagging interrogatory. One of the judges said
that she had been foolish to aid the English
because, he said, the English are ungrateful.</p>

<p>"No," replied Miss Cavell, "the English are
not ungrateful."</p>

<p>"How do you know they are not?" asked the
inquisitor.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Miss Cavell
makes a
fatal admission.</div>

<p>"Because," she answered, "some of them have
written to me from England to thank me."</p>

<p>It was a fatal admission on the part of the
tortured little woman; under the German military<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
law her having helped soldiers to reach
Holland, a neutral country, would have been
a less serious offense, but to aid them to reach
an enemy country, and especially England, was
the last offense in the eyes of the German military
court.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rumor
that death
sentence
is asked.</div>

<p>The trial was concluded on Saturday, and
on Sunday one of the nurses in Miss Cavell's
school came to tell me that there was a rumor
about town that the prosecuting officer had
asked the court to pronounce a sentence of
death in the cases of the Princess de Croy, the
Countess de Belleville, and of Miss Cavell, and
of several others. I remember to have said to
Ma&icirc;tre de Leval, when he came up to my room
to report the astounding news:</p>

<p>"That's only the usual exaggeration of the
prosecutor; they all ask for the extreme
penalty, everywhere, when they sum up their
cases."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Leval's
opinion of
German
courts.</div>

<p>"Yes," said Ma&icirc;tre de Leval, "and in German
courts they always get it."</p>

<p>Ma&icirc;tre de Leval sent a note to Ma&icirc;tre Kirschen,
asking him to come on Monday, at eight-thirty
o'clock, to the Legation or to send a
word regarding Miss Cavell. Ma&icirc;tre Kirschen
did not send Ma&icirc;tre de Leval the word he had
requested, and on that Sunday, de Leval saw
another lawyer who had been on the case and
could tell him what had taken place at the
trial. The lawyer thought that the court martial
would not condemn Miss Cavell to death.
At any rate, no judgment had been pronounced,
and the judges themselves did not appear
to be in agreement.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Leval
asks to
see Miss
Cavell.</div>

<p>On Monday, the eleventh of October, at eight-thirty
in the morning, Ma&icirc;tre de Leval went to
the <i>Politische Abteilung</i> in the Rue Lambermont,
and found Conrad. He spoke to him of
the case of Miss Cavell and asked that, now
that the trial had taken place, he and the Reverend<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
Mr. Gahan, the rector of the English
church, be allowed to see Miss Cavell. Conrad
said he would make inquiries and inform de
Leval by telephone, and by one of the messengers
of the Legation who that morning happened
to deliver some papers to the <i>Politische
Abteilung</i>, Conrad sent word that neither the
Reverend Mr. Gahan nor Ma&icirc;tre de Leval could
see Miss Cavell at that time, but that Ma&icirc;tre
de Leval could see her as soon as the judgment
had been pronounced.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Waiting
for judgment
to
be pronounced.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Promise
to inform
the
Legation.</div>

<p>At eleven-thirty o'clock on the Monday
morning, Ma&icirc;tre de Leval himself telephoned
to Conrad, who repeated this statement. The
judgment had not yet been rendered, he said,
and Ma&icirc;tre de Leval asked him to let him know
as soon as the judgment had been pronounced,
so that he might go to see Miss Cavell. Conrad
promised this, but added that even then the
Reverend Mr. Gahan could not see her, because
there were German Protestant pastors at the
prison, and that if Miss Cavell needed spiritual
advice or consolation she could call on them.
Conrad concluded this conversation by saying
that the judgment would be rendered on the
morrow, that is, on Tuesday, or the day after,
and that even when it had been pronounced it
would have to be signed by the Military
Governor, and that the Legation would be kept
informed.</p>

<p>At twelve-ten on the Monday, not having
received any news from Ma&icirc;tre Kirschen, Ma&icirc;tre
de Leval went to his house, but did not find
him there, and left his card.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Leval
makes repeated
inquiries.</div>

<p>At twelve-twenty o'clock, Ma&icirc;tre de Leval
went to the house of the lawyer to whom reference
has already been made, and left word for
him to go to his home.</p>

<p>At four o'clock that afternoon the lawyer
arrived at the Legation and said that he had
been to see the Germans at eleven o'clock, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
that there he had been told no judgment would
be pronounced before the following day. Before
leaving the Legation to go home, Ma&icirc;tre
de Leval told to Gibson all that had happened,
and asked him to telephone again to
Conrad before going home himself. Then at
intervals all day long the inquiry had been
repeated, and the same response was made.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
chancellerie
was
closed for
the night.</div>

<p>Monday evening at six-twenty o'clock, Belgian
time, Topping, one of the clerks of the Legation,
with Gibson standing by, again called
Conrad on the telephone, again was told that
the judgment had not been pronounced, and
that the Political Department would not fail to
inform the Legation the moment the judgment
was confirmed. And the <i>chancellerie</i> was
closed for the night.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A nurse
informs
Leval of
the death
sentence.</div>

<p>At nine o'clock that Monday evening, Ma&icirc;tre
de Leval appeared suddenly at the door of my
chamber; his face was deadly pallid; he said
that he had just heard from the nurse who kept
him informed, that the judgment had been confirmed
and that the sentence of death had been
pronounced on Miss Cavell at half-past four
o'clock that afternoon, and that she was to be
shot at two o'clock the next morning. It
seemed preposterous, especially the immediate
execution of sentence; there had always been
time at least to prepare and present a plea for
mercy. To condemn a woman in the evening
and then to hurry her out to be shot before
another dawn! Impossible! It could not be!</p>

<div class="sidenote">Judgment
read in
the afternoon.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Plea for
mercy had
been prepared.</div>

<p>But no; Ma&icirc;tre de Leval was certain. That
evening he had gone home and was writing at
his table when about eight o'clock two nurses
were introduced. One was Miss Wilkinson,
little and nervous, all in tears; the other, taller
and more calm. Miss Wilkinson said that she
had just learned that the judgment of the
court condemned Miss Cavell to death, that
the judgment had been read to her in her cell<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
at four-thirty that afternoon, and that the
Germans were going to shoot her that night at
two o'clock. Ma&icirc;tre de Leval told her that it
was difficult to believe such news, since twice
he had been told that the judgment had not
been rendered and that it would not be rendered
before the following day, but on her
reiteration that she had this news from a source
that was absolutely certain, de Leval left at
once with her and her friends and came to the
Legation. And there he stood, pale and shaken.
Even then I could not believe; it was too preposterous;
surely a stay of execution would be
granted. Already in the afternoon, in some
premonition, Ma&icirc;tre de Leval had prepared a
plea for mercy, to be submitted to the Governor-General,
and a letter of transmittal to present
to the Baron von der Lancken. I asked Ma&icirc;tre
de Leval to bring me these documents and I
signed them, and then, at the last minute, on
the letter addressed to von der Lancken, I
wrote these words:</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mr. Whitlock's
personal
appeal.</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Baron</span>:</p>

<p>"I am too sick to present my request to you
in person, but I appeal to your generosity of
heart to support it, and save this unfortunate
woman from death. Have pity on her."</p></div>

<div class="sidenote">Search
for the
Spanish
ambassador.</div>

<p>I told Ma&icirc;tre de Leval to send Joseph at
once to hunt up Gibson to present my plea and,
if possible, to find the Marquis de Villalobar
and to ask him to support it with the Baron
von der Lancken. Gibson was dining somewhere;
we did not know where Villalobar was.
The <i>Politische Abteilung</i>, in the Ministry of
Industry, where Baron von der Lancken lived,
was only half a dozen blocks away. The
Governor-General was in his ch&acirc;teau at Trois
Fontaines, ten miles away, playing bridge
that evening. Ma&icirc;tre de Leval went; and I
waited.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span></p>

<p>The nurses from Miss Cavell's school were
waiting in a lower room; other nurses came
for news; they, too, had heard, but could not
believe. Then the Reverend Mr. H. Stirling
T. Gahan, the British chaplain at Brussels and
pastor of the English church, came. He had a
note from some one at the St. Gilles prison, a
note written in German, saying simply:</p>

<div class="sidenote">English
rector
summoned.</div>

<p>"Come at once; some one is about to die."</p>

<div class="sidenote">A delay
of <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'executive'">execution</ins>
expected.</div>

<p>He went away to the prison; his frail, delicate
little wife remained at the Legation, and
there, with my wife and Miss Larner, sat with
those women all that long evening, trying to
comfort them, to reassure them. Outside a
cold rain was falling. Up in my chamber I
waited; a stay of execution would be granted,
of course; they always were; there was not, in
our time, anywhere, a court, even a court
martial, that would condemn a woman to death
at half-past four in the afternoon and hurry her
out and shoot her before dawn&mdash;not even a
German court martial.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Miss
Cavell
calm and
courageous.</div>

<p>When Mr. Gahan arrived at the prison that
night Miss Cavell was lying on the narrow cot
in her cell; she arose, drew on a dressing gown,
folded it about her thin form, and received him
calmly. She had never expected such an end
to the trial, but she was brave and was not
afraid to die. The judgment had been read to
her that afternoon, there in her cell. She had
written letters to her mother in England and
to certain of her friends, and entrusted them
to the German authorities.</p>

<p>She did not complain of her trial; she had
avowed all, she said; and it is one of the saddest,
bitterest ironies of the whole tragedy
that she seems not to have known that all she
had avowed was not sufficient, even under
German law, to justify the judgment passed
upon her. The German chaplain had been
kind, and she was willing for him to be with her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
at the last, if Mr. Gahan could not be. Life
had not been all happy for her, she said, and
she was glad to die for her country. Life had
been hurried, and she was grateful for these
weeks of rest in prison.</p>

<p>"Patriotism is not enough," she said, "I
must have no hatred and no bitterness toward
any one."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Notes
made in
Bible and
prayer-book.</div>

<p>She received the sacrament, she had no
hatred for any one, and she had no regrets.
In the touching report that Mr. Gahan made
there is a statement, one of the last that Edith
Cavell ever made, which, in its exquisite pathos,
illuminates the whole of that life of stern duty,
of human service and martyrdom. She said
that she was grateful for the six weeks of rest
she had just before the end. During those
weeks she had read and reflected; her companions
and her solace were her Bible, her
prayer-book and the "Imitation of Christ." The
notes she made in these books reveal her
thoughts in that time, and will touch the uttermost
depths of any nature nourished in that
beautiful faith which is at once so tender and
so austere. The prayer-book with those laconic
entries on its fly-leaf, in which she set down
the sad and eloquent chronology of her fate,
the copy of the "Imitation" which she had
read and marked during those weeks in prison&mdash;weeks,
which, as she so pathetically said, had
given her rest and quiet and time to think in a
life that had been "so hurried"&mdash;and the passages
noted in her firm hand have a deep and
appealing pathos.</p>

<p>Just before the end, too, as I have said, she
wrote a number of letters. She forgot no one.
Among the letters that she left one was addressed
to the nurses of her school; and there
was a message for a girl who was trying to
break herself of the morphine habit&mdash;Miss
Cavell had been trying to help her, and she sent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
her word to be brave, and that if God would
permit she would continue to try to help her.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The petitioners
fail.</div>

<p>Midnight came, and Gibson, with a dark
face, and de Leval, paler than ever. There
was nothing to be done.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Errand of
Marquis
Villalobar,
Gibson
and de
Leval.</div>

<p>De Leval had gone to Gibson, and together
they went in search of the Marquis, whom they
found at Baron Lambert's, where he had been
dining; he and Baron Lambert and M. Francqui
were over their coffee. The three, the
Marquis, Gibson and de Leval, then went to
the Rue Lambermont. The little Ministry was
closed and dark; no one was there. They rang,
and rang again, and finally the <i>concierge</i> appeared&mdash;no
one was there, he said. They insisted.
The <i>concierge</i> at last found a German
functionary who came down, stood staring
stupidly; every one was gone; <i>son Excellence</i>
was at the theater. At what theater? He did
not know. They urged him to go and find out.
He disappeared inside, went up and down
stairs two or three times, finally came out
and said that he was at Le Bois Sacr&eacute;. They
explained that the presence of the Baron was
urgent and asked the man to go for him;
they turned over the motor to him and he
mounted on the box beside Eugene. They
reached the little variety theater there in the
Rue d'Arenberg. The German functionary
went in and found the Baron, who said he
could not come before the piece was over.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
sad wait
for der
Lancken.</div>

<p>All this while Villalobar, Gibson and de
Leval were in the salon at the Ministry, the
room of which I have spoken so often as the
yellow salon, because of the satin upholstery of
its Louis XVI. furniture of white lacquer&mdash;that
bright, almost laughing little salon, all done in
the gayest, lightest tones, where so many little
dramas were played. All three of them were
deeply moved and very anxious&mdash;the eternal
contrast, as de Leval said, between things and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
sentiments. Lancken entered at last, very
much surprised to find them; he was accompanied
by Count Harrach and by the young
Baron von Falkenhausen.</p>

<p>"What is it, gentlemen?" he said. "Has
something serious happened?"</p>

<p>They told him why they were there, and
Lancken, raising his hands, said:</p>

<p>"<i>Impossible!</i>"</p>

<div class="sidenote"><ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'De-'">Der</ins>
Lancken
believes
the rumor
false.</div>

<p>He had vaguely heard that afternoon of a
condemnation for spying, but he did not know
that it had anything to do with the case of
Miss Cavell, and in any event it was impossible
that they would put a woman to death that
night.</p>

<p>"Who has given you this information? Because,
to come and disturb me at such an hour
you must have actual information," he said.</p>

<p>De Leval replied: "Without doubt I consider
it so, but I must refuse to tell you from whom I
received the information. Besides, what difference
does it make? If the information is
true, our presence at this hour is justified; if
it is not true, I am ready to take the consequences
of my mistake."</p>

<p>The Baron grew irritated.</p>

<p>"What," he said, "is it on the hint of mere
rumor that you come and disturb me at such
an hour, me and these gentlemen? No, no,
gentlemen, this news can not be true. Orders
are never executed with such precipitation, especially
when a woman is concerned. Come
and see me to-morrow. Besides, how do you
think that at this hour I can obtain any information?
The Governor-General must certainly
be sleeping."</p>

<p>Gibson, or one of them, suggested to him
that a very simple way of finding out would
be to telephone to the prison.</p>

<p>"Quite right," said he. "I had not thought
of that."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span></p>

<p>He went out, was gone a few minutes and
came back embarrassed, so they said, even a
little bit ashamed, for he said:</p>

<div class="sidenote">The sad
news confirmed.</div>

<p>"You are right, gentlemen; I have heard by
telephone that Miss Cavell has been condemned
and that she will be shot to-night."</p>

<p>Then de Leval drew out the letter that I had
written to the Baron and gave it to him, and he
read it in an undertone&mdash;with a little sardonic
smile, de Leval said&mdash;and when he had finished
he handed it back to de Leval and said:</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
plea for
mercy.</div>

<p>"But it is necessary to have a plea for mercy
at the same time."</p>

<p>"Here it is," said de Leval, and gave him the
document. Then they all sat down.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Von der
Lancken's
attitude.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Miss
Cavell
not a spy.</div>

<p>I could see the scene as it was described to
me by Villalobar, by Gibson, by de Leval, in
that pretty little Louis XVI. salon that I knew
so well&mdash;Lancken giving way to an outburst
of feeling against "that spy," as he called Miss
Cavell, and Gibson and de Leval by turns pleading
with him, the Marquis sitting by. It was
not a question of spying as they pointed out;
it was a question of the life of a woman, a
life that had been devoted to charity, to helping
others. She had nursed wounded soldiers,
she had even nursed German wounded at the
beginning of the war, and now she was accused
of but one thing: having helped English
soldiers make their way toward Holland. She
may have been imprudent, she may have acted
against the laws of the occupying power, but
she was not a spy, she was not even accused of
being a spy, she had not been convicted of spying,
and she did not merit the death of a spy.
They sat there pleading, Gibson and de Leval,
bringing forth all the arguments that would
occur to men of sense and sensibility. Gibson
called Lancken's attention to their failure to
inform the Legation of the sentence, of their
failure to keep the word that Conrad had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
given. He argued that the offense charged
against Miss Cavell had long since been accomplished,
that as she had been for some
weeks in prison a slight delay in carrying out
the sentence could not endanger the German
cause; he even pointed out the effect such a
deed as the summary execution of the death
sentence against a woman would have upon
public opinion, not only in Belgium, but in
America, and elsewhere; he even spoke of the
possibility of reprisals.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
military
authority
supreme.</div>

<p>But it was all in vain. Baron von der
Lancken explained to them that the Military
Governor, that is, General von Saubersweig,
was the supreme authority in matters of this
sort, that an appeal from his decision lay only
to the Emperor, that the Governor-General
himself had no authority to intervene in such
cases, and that under the provisions of German
martial law it lay within the discretion of
the Military Governor whether he would accept
or refuse an appeal for clemency. And then
Villalobar suddenly cried out:</p>

<p>"Oh, come now! It's a woman; you can't
shoot a woman like that!"</p>

<p>The Baron paused, was evidently moved.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," he said, "it is past eleven
o'clock; what can be done?"</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lancken
goes to
von
Saubersweig.</div>

<p>It was only von Saubersweig who could act,
he had said, and they urged the Baron to go
to see von Saubersweig. Finally he consented.
While he was gone Villalobar, Gibson and de
Leval repeated to Harrach and von Falkenhausen
all the arguments that might move
them. Von Falkenhausen was young, he had
been to Cambridge in England, and he was
touched, though of course he was powerless.
And de Leval says that when he gave signs of
showing pity, Harrach cast a glance at him,
so that he said nothing more, and then Harrach
said:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span></p>

<p>"The life of one German soldier seems to us
much more important than that of all these old
English nurses."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lancken's
return.</div>

<p>At last Lancken returned and, standing
there, announced:</p>

<p>"I am exceedingly sorry, but the Governor
tells me that only after due reflection was the
execution decided upon, and that he will not
change his decision. Under his prerogative he
even refuses to receive the plea for mercy.
Therefore, no one, not even the Emperor, can
do anything for you."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The plea
for mercy
handed
back.</div>

<p>With this he handed my letter and the
<i>requ&ecirc;te en grace</i> back to Gibson. There was
a moment of silence in the yellow salon. Then
Villalobar sprang up and seizing Lancken by
the shoulder said to him in an energetic tone:</p>

<p>"Baron, I wish to speak to you."</p>

<p>"It is useless," began Lancken.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Marquis
Villalobar
pleads.</div>

<p>But the old Spanish pride had been mounting
in the Marquis, and he literally dragged the
tall von der Lancken into a little room near
by, and then voices were heard in sharp discussion,
and even through the partition the
voice of Villalobar:</p>

<p>"It is idiotic, this thing you are going to do;
you will have another Louvain."</p>

<p>A few moments later they came back, Villalobar
in silent rage, Lancken very red. And, as
de Leval said, without another word, dumb, in
consternation, filled with an immense despair,
they came away.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
messengers
withdraw.</div>

<p>I heard the report, and they withdrew. A
little while and I heard the street door open.
The women who had waited all that night
went out into the rain.</p>

<p>The rain had ceased and the air was soft and
warm the next morning; the sunlight shone
through an autumn haze. But over the city
the horror of the dreadful deed hung like a
pall.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Other
prisoners
condemned.</div>

<p>Twenty-six others were condemned with
Miss Cavell, four of whom were sentenced to
death: Philippe Baucq, an architect of Brussels;
Louise Thuiliez, a school-teacher at Lille;
Louis Severin, a pharmacist of Brussels; and
the Countess Jeanne de Belleville of Montignies-sur-Roc.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Severe
sentences.</div>

<p>Harman Capian, a civil engineer of Wasmes;
Mrs. Ada Bodart of Brussels; Albert Libiez, a
lawyer of Wasmes; and Georges Derveau, a
pharmacist of P&acirc;turages, were sentenced each
to fifteen years' penal servitude at hard labor.</p>

<p>The Princess Maria de Croy was sentenced
to ten years' penal servitude at hard labor.</p>

<p>Seventeen others were sentenced to hard
labor or to terms of imprisonment of from two
to five years. The eight remaining were acquitted.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The people
horrified
at Miss
Cavell's
execution.</div>

<p>All day long sad and solemn groups stood
under the trees in the boulevards amid the
falling leaves discussing the crime in horrified
tones. The horror of it pervaded the house.
I found my wife weeping at evening; no need
to ask what was the matter; the wife of the
chaplain had been there, with some detail of
Miss Cavell's last hours: how she had arisen
wearily from her cot at the coming of the
clergyman, drawing her dressing-gown about
her thin throat.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The body
not given
to friends.</div>

<p>I sent a note to Baron von der Lancken
asking that the Governor-General permit the
body of Miss Cavell to be buried by the American
Legation and the friends of the dead girl.
In reply he came himself to see me in the afternoon.
He was very solemn, and said that he
wished to express his regret in the circumstances,
but that he had done all he could.
The body, he said, had already been interred,
with respect and with religious rites, in a quiet
place, and under the law it could not be exhumed
without an order from the Imperial<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
Government. The Governor-General himself
had gone to Berlin.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Whitlock
and
Villalobar.</div>

<p>And then came Villalobar, and I thanked
him for what he had done. He told me much,
and described the scene the night before in
that anteroom with Lancken. The Marquis
was much concerned about the Countess Jeanne
de Belleville and Madame Thuiliez, both
French, and hence prot&eacute;g&eacute;es of his, condemned
to die within eight days; but I told him not to
be concerned; that the effect of Miss Cavell's
martyrdom did not end with her death; it
would procure other liberations, this among
them; the thirst for blood had been slaked and
there would be no more executions in that
group; it was the way of the law of blood
vengeance. We talked a long time about the
tragedy and about the even larger tragedy of
the war.</p>

<p>"We are getting old," he said. "Life is
going; and after the war, if we live in that new
world, we shall be of the old&mdash;the new generation
will push us aside."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Miss
Cavell's
death wins
mercy for
others.</div>

<p>Gibson and de Leval prepared reports of the
whole matter, and I sent them by the next
courier to our Embassy at London. But somehow
that very day the news got into Holland
and shocked the world. Richards, of the
C. R. B., just back from The Hague, said that
they had already heard of it there and were
filled with horror. And even the Germans,
who seemed always to do a deed and to consider
its effect afterward, knew that they had
another Louvain, another <i>Lusitania</i>, for which
to answer before the bar of civilization. The
lives of the three others remaining, of the five
condemned to death, were ultimately spared,
as I had told Villalobar they would be. The
King of Spain and the President of the United
States made representations at Berlin in behalf
of the Countess de Belleville and Madame<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
Thuiliez, and their sentences were commuted
to imprisonment, as was that of Louis Severin,
the Brussels druggist. The storm of universal
loathing and reprobation for the deed was too
much even for the Germans.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>In an earlier chapter we have read of the beginning
of the attempt to cross the Dardanelles
and to capture the Peninsula of Gallipoli. After
great losses and terrible suffering had been endured
in these attempts, it was decided in December,
1915, by the British war authorities that
further sacrifices were not justified. Preparations
were accordingly made to abandon the
enterprise. How these plans were carried out
is told in the chapter following.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span></p>






<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>GALLIPOLI ABANDONED</h2>

<h3>GENERAL SIR CHARLES C. MONRO</h3>


<p>On October 20, 1915, in London, I received
instructions to proceed as soon as possible
to the Near East and take over the
command of the Mediterranean Expeditionary
Force.</p>

<div class="sidenote">General
Monro's
orders on
arrival.</div>

<p>My duty on arrival was in broad outline:</p>

<p>(a) To report on the military situation on
the Gallipoli Peninsula.</p>

<p>(b) To express an opinion whether on purely
military grounds the Peninsula should be
evacuated or another attempt made to carry it.</p>

<p>(c) The number of troops that would be required&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) To carry the Peninsula.</p>

<p>(2) To keep the strait open, and</p>

<p>(3) To take Constantinople.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Military
defects in
positions
occupied.</div>

<p>The positions occupied by our troops presented
a military situation unique in history.
The mere fringe of the coast line had been secured.
The beaches and piers upon which they
depended for all requirements in personnel and
material were exposed to registered and observed
artillery fire. Our intrenchments were
dominated almost throughout by the Turks.
The possible artillery positions were insufficient
and defective. The force, in short, held a line
possessing every possible military defect. The
position was without depth, the communications
were insecure and dependent on the
weather.</p>

<p>No means existed for the concealment and
deployment of fresh troops destined for the
offensive&mdash;while the Turks enjoyed full powers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
of observation, abundant artillery positions,
and they <ins title="Transcriber's Note: this word not present in the original">had</ins> been given the time to supplement
the natural advantages which the position
presented by all the devices at the disposal of
the field engineer.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Disease,
loss of
competent
officers,
make-shift
organization.</div>

<p>Another material factor came prominently
before me. The troops on the Peninsula had
suffered much from various causes&mdash;exposure
to shell fire, disease, the dearth of competent
officers owing to earlier losses, and "make-shifts"
due to the attachment of Yeomanry
and Mounted Brigades to the Territorial
Divisions. Other arguments, irrefutable in
their conclusions, convinced me that a complete
evacuation was the only wise course to
pursue.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Consequences
of
unusual
storms.</div>

<p>On November 21, 1915 the Peninsula was
visited by a storm said to be nearly unprecedented
for the time of the year. The storm
was accompanied by torrential rain, which
lasted for twenty-four hours. This was followed
by hard frost and a heavy blizzard. In
the areas of the Eighth Corps and the Anzac
Corps the effects were not felt to a very marked
degree owing to the protection offered by the
surrounding hills. The Ninth Corps was less
favorably situated, the water courses in this
area became converted into surging rivers,
which carried all before them. The water rose
in many places to the height of the parapets
and all means of communications were prevented.</p>

<p>The men, drenched as they were by the
rain, suffered from the subsequent blizzard
most severely. Large numbers collapsed from
exposure and exhaustion, and in spite of untiring
efforts that were made to mitigate the
suffering I regret to announce that there were
200 deaths from exposure and over 10,000 sick
evacuated during the first few days of December.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span></p>

<p>From reports given by deserters it is probable
that the Turks suffered even to a greater
degree.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Difficulties
pertaining to
withdrawal.</div>

<p>The problem with which we were confronted
was the withdrawal of an army of a considerable
size from positions in no cases more than
300 yards from the enemy's trenches, and its
embarkation on open beaches, every part of
which was within effective range of Turkish
guns, and from which in winds from the south
or southwest, the withdrawal of troops was
not possible.</p>

<p>I came to the conclusion that our chances
of success were infinitely more probable if we
made no departure of any kind from the normal
life which we were following both on sea
and on land. A feint which did not fully fulfill
its purpose would have been worse than
useless, and there was the obvious danger that
the suspicions of the Turks would be aroused
by our adoption of a course the real purport
of which could not have been long
disguised.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Unsettled
weather a
menace.</div>

<p>Rapidity of action was imperative, having
in view the unsettled weather which might be
expected in the &AElig;gean. The success of our
operations was entirely dependent on weather
conditions. Even a mild wind from the south
or southwest was found to raise such a ground
swell as to greatly impede communication with
the beaches, while anything in the nature of
a gale from this direction could not fail to
break up the piers, wreck the small craft, and
thus definitely prevent any steps being taken
toward withdrawal.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Evacuation
of
supplies
continues
satisfactorily.</div>

<p>Throughout the period December 10 to 18,
1915 the withdrawal proceeded under the most
auspicious conditions, and the morning of December
18, 1915, found the positions both at
Anzac and Suvla reduced to the numbers determined,
while the evacuation of guns, animals,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
stores, and supplies had continued most satisfactorily.</p>

<p>It was imperative, of course, that the front-line
trenches should be held, however lightly,
until the very last moment and that the withdrawal
from these trenches should be simultaneous
throughout the line.</p>

<p>The good fortune which had attended the
evacuation continued during the night of the
19th-20th. The night was perfectly calm with
a slight haze over the moon, an additional
stroke of good luck, as there was a full moon
on that night.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Final
withdrawals
from
Anzac and
Suvla.</div>

<p>Soon after dark the covering ships were all
in position, and the final withdrawal began.
At 1:30 A. M. the withdrawal of the rear
parties commenced from the front trenches at
Suvla and the left of Anzac. Those on the
right of Anzac who were nearer the beach remained
in position until 2 A. M. By 5:30 A. M.
the last man had quit the trenches.</p>

<p>At Anzac, four 18-pounder guns, two 5-inch
howitzers, one 4.7 naval gun, one anti-air craft,
and two 3-pounder Hotchkiss guns were left,
but they were destroyed before the troops
finally embarked. In addition, fifty-six mules,
a certain number of carts, mostly stripped of
their wheels, and some supplies which were
set on fire, were also abandoned.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A few
supplies
destroyed.</div>

<p>At Suvla every gun, vehicle and animal was
embarked, and all that remained was a small
stock of supplies, which were burned.</p>

<p>On December 28, 1915, your Lordship's telegram
ordering the evacuation of Helles was received,
whereupon, in view of the possibility of
bad weather intervening, I instructed the General
Officer Commanding Dardanelles Army to
complete the operation as rapidly as possible.
He was reminded that every effort conditional
on not exposing the personnel to undue risk
should be made to save all 60-pounder and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
18-pounder guns, 6-inch and 4.5 howitzers,
with their ammunition and other accessories,
such as mules, and A. T. carts, limbered
wagons, &amp;c.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Situation
on Gallipoli
Peninsula.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Increase
in Turkish
artillery.</div>

<p>At a meeting which was attended by the
Vice Admiral and the General Officer Commanding
Dardanelles Army I explained the
course which I thought we should adopt to
again deceive the Turks as to our intentions.
The situation on the Peninsula had not materially
changed owing to our withdrawal from
Suvla and Anzac, except that there was a
marked increased activity in aerial reconnoissance
over our positions, and the islands of
Mudros and Imbros, and that hostile patrolling
of our trenches was more frequent and daring.
The most apparent factor was that the number
of heavy guns on the European and Asiatic
shores had been considerably augmented, and
that these guns were more liberally supplied
with German ammunition, the result of which
was that our beaches were continuously shelled,
especially from the Asiatic shore. I gave it as
my opinion that in my judgment I did not regard
a feint as an operation offering any prospect
of success; and it was decided the navy
should do their utmost to pursue a course of
retaliation against the Turkish batteries,
but to refrain from any unusually aggressive
attitude should the Turkish guns remain
quiescent.</p>

<div class="sidenote">General
Birdwood's
comprehensive
plans.</div>

<p>General Sir W. Birdwood had, in anticipation
of being ordered to evacuate Helles, made such
complete and far-seeing arrangements that he
was able to proceed without delay to the issue
of the comprehensive orders which the consummation
of such a delicate operation in war
requires.</p>

<div class="sidenote">French
infantry
embarked.</div>

<p>The evacuation, following the same system
as was practiced at Suvla and Anzac, proceeded
without delay. The French infantry remaining<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
on the Peninsula were relieved on the night of
January 1-2, 1916, and were embarked by the
French navy on the following nights. Progress,
however, was slower than had been hoped, owing
to delays caused by accident and the
weather. One of our largest horse ships was
sunk by a French battleship, whereby the withdrawal
was considerably retarded, and at the
same time strong winds sprang up which interfered
materially with work on the beaches.
The character of the weather now setting in
offered so little hope of a calm period of any
duration that General Sir W. Birdwood arranged
with Admiral Sir J. de Robeck for the
assistance of some destroyers in order to accelerate
the progress of re-embarkation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Turks
shell
trenches
and
beaches.</div>

<p>Meanwhile the Eighth Corps had maintained
the offensive spirit in bombing and minor operations
with which they had established the
moral superiority they enjoyed over the enemy.
On December 29, 1915 the Fifty-second Division
completed the excellent work which they had
been carrying out for so long by capturing a
considerable portion of the Turkish trenches,
and by successfully holding these in the face
of repeated counter-attacks. The shelling of
our trenches and beaches, however, increased
in frequency and intensity, and the average
daily casualties continued to increase.</p>

<p>On January 7, 1916, the enemy developed
heavy artillery fire on the trenches held by
the Thirteenth Division, while the Asiatic guns
shelled those occupied by the Royal Naval Division.
The bombardment, which was reported
to be the heaviest experienced since we landed
in April, lasted from noon until 5 P. M., and
was intensive between 3 and 3:30 P. M.</p>

<p>January 8, 1916 was a bright, calm day, with
a light breeze from the south. There was every
indication of the continuance of favorable conditions,
and, in the opinion of the meteorological<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
officer, no important change was to be expected
for at least twenty-four hours. The
Turkish artillery was unusually inactive. All
preparations for the execution of the final stage
were complete.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Unfavorable
weather.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Hostile
submarine
near by.</div>

<p>About 7 P. M. the breeze freshened considerably
from the southwest, the most unfavorable
quarter, but the first trip, timed for 8 P. M.,
was dispatched without difficulty. The wind,
however, continued to rise until, by 11 P. M.,
the connecting pier between the hulks and
the shore at "W" Beach was washed away by
heavy seas, and further embarkation into destroyers
from these hulks became impracticable.
In spite of these difficulties the second trips,
which commenced at 11:30 P. M., were carried
out well up to time, and the embarkation of
guns continued uninterruptedly. Early in the
evening reports had been received from the
right flank that a hostile submarine was believed
to be moving down the strait, and about
midnight H. M. S. <i>Prince George</i>, which had
embarked 2,000 men, and was sailing for
Mudros, reported she was struck by a torpedo
which failed to explode. The indications of the
presence of a submarine added considerably
to the anxiety for the safety of the troop carriers,
and made it necessary for the Vice Admiral
to modify the arrangements made for
the subsequent bombardment of the evacuated
positions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Gully
Beach
embarkation
completed.</div>

<p>At 1:50 A. M., Gully Beach reported that
the embarkation at that beach was complete,
and that the lighters were about to push off,
but at 2:10 A. M. a telephone message was received
that one of the lighters was aground
and could not be refloated. The N. T. O. at
once took all possible steps to have another
lighter sent in to Gully Beach, and this was, as
a matter of fact, done within an hour, but in
the meantime, at 2:30 A. M. it was decided to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
move the 160 men who had been relanded from
the grounded lighter to "W" Beach and embark
them there.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Conflagrations
show
Turks the
allies have
withdrawn.</div>

<p>At 3:30 A. M. the evacuation was complete,
and abandoned heaps of stores and supplies
were successfully set on fire by time fuses after
the last man had embarked. Two magazines of
ammunition and explosives were also successfully
blown up at 4 A. M. These conflagrations
were apparently the first intimation
received by the Turks that we had withdrawn.
Red lights were immediately discharged
from the enemy's trenches, and heavy artillery
fire opened on our trenches and beaches.
This shelling was maintained until about
6:30 A. M.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Good
luck and
skilled
organization
forthcoming.</div>

<p>Apart from four unserviceable fifteen-pounders
which had been destroyed earlier in the
month, ten worn-out fifteen-pounders, one six-inch
Mark VII gun, and six old heavy French
guns, all of which were previously blown up,
were left on the Peninsula. In addition to the
above, 508 animals, most of which were destroyed,
and a number of vehicles and considerable
quantities of stores, material, and supplies,
all of which were destroyed by burning, had to
be abandoned.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Competent
officers in
charge.</div>

<p>The entire evacuation of the Peninsula had
now been completed. It demanded for its successful
realization two important military essentials,
viz., good luck and skilled disciplined
organization, and they were both forthcoming
to a marked degree at the hour needed. Our
luck was in the ascendant by the marvelous
spell of calm weather which prevailed. But we
were able to turn to the fullest advantage these
accidents of fortune.</p>

<p>Lieutenant General Sir W. Birdwood and
his corps commanders elaborated and prepared
the orders in reference to the evacuation with a
skill, competence, and courage which could not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
have been surpassed, and we had a further
stroke of good fortune in being associated with
Vice Admiral Sir J. de Robeck, K. C. B., Vice
Admiral Wemyss, and a body of naval officers
whose work remained throughout this anxious
period at that standard of accuracy and professional
ability which is beyond the power of
criticism or cavil.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The form of "frightfulness" in which the
Germans placed the greatest faith was the terrorizing
of the inhabitants of unprotected
enemy cities by bombs from Zeppelins and
aeroplanes. While the objects for which these
atrocities were perpetrated were not attained,
hundreds of innocent men, women, and children
were murdered. The following narrative
describes one of these German air raids.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span></p>

<h2>THE DEATH-SHIP IN THE SKY</h2>

<h3>PERRITON MAXWELL</h3>


<div class="sidenote">The
switchman
at Walthamstow.</div>

<p>For twenty-six years old Tom Cumbers had
held his job as switchman at the Walthamstow
railroad junction where the
London-bound trains come up from Southend
to the great city. It was an important post
and old Tom filled it with stolid British efficiency.
A kindly man who felt himself an
integral part of the giant railroad system that
employed him, old Tom had few interests beyond
his work, his white-haired wife, his reeking
pipe and the little four-room tenement in
Walthamstow which he called home. The
latter was one of the thousands of two-storied
rabbit-hatches of sooty, yellow brick, all alike
and all incredibly ugly, which stretch, mile
upon mile, from Walthamstow toward London's
tumultuous heart.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The workshops

Forest.</div>



<div class="sidenote">An
appalling
tragedy
of the
war.</div>

<p>Within a radius of four dun miles, just on
the nearer edge of Epping Forest&mdash;the scene
in a forgotten day of Robin Hood's adventurings&mdash;a
section of these huddling homes of the
submerged, together with a street of trams and
some pathetic shops, constitute this town of
Walthamstow. It is a sordid, unlovely place,
but for some ten thousand wage-strugglers it
is all of England. There are workshops hereabout
in which one may mingle one's copious
sweat with the grime of machinery and have
fourteen shillings a week into the bargain&mdash;if
one is properly skilled and muscular and
bovinely plodding. Walthamstow is not the
place where one would deliberately choose to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
live if bread could be earned elsewhere with
equal certainty. But for all its dirt and dullness
it has a spot on the map and a meaning
in the dull souls of its inhabitants, and here,
within half an hour's train travel of the Lord
Mayor's Mansion and the golden vaults of the
Bank of England, transpired on the sweltering
night of which I write, one of the most
witless and appalling tragedies of the present
war. Forever memorable in the hitherto colorless
calendar of Walthamstow will be this
tragedy in the second year of Armageddon.</p>

<div class="sidenote">An
ordinary
hot night.</div>

<div class="sidenote">News of
the war.</div>

<p>Beyond the stenchful heat-stress of it, there
was nothing up to half-past eleven to mark
this night as different from its fellows of the
past. From eight o'clock till ten the small activities
of the town centered chiefly about its
tramway terminus, its smudgy station, its
three or four moving-picture theatres, and its
fetid pubs. On the pavements, in the roadways
and at every crossing, corduroyed men yawned
and spat, and slatternly women, most of them
with whimpering infants in their arms, talked
of shop or household cares and the frailties of
their neighbors. Some, more alive to the big
events of a clashing world, repeated the meagre
news of the ha'penny press and dwelt with
prideful fervor on the latest bit of heroism reported
from the front. Now and again an outburst
of raucous humor echoed above the babble
of cockney tongues. The maudlin clamor of "a
pore lone lidy 'oos 'subing 'ad desarted 'er"
failed to arouse anyone's curiosity. Ladies in
their cups are not a rarity in Walthamstow.
In side streets, lads in khaki, many of them
fresh from fields of slaughter "somewhere in
Flanders," sported boisterously with their
factory-girl sweethearts or spooned in the
shadows. Everywhere grubby children in scant
clothing shrilled and scampered and got in the
way. Humidity enveloped the town like a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
sodden cloak and its humanity stewed in moist
and smelly discomfort.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Street
lamps out.</div>

<p>But shortly after eleven o'clock the whole
place became suddenly and majestically still
and black. People who go to their work at
sunrise cannot afford the extravagance of midnight
revelry, and there are few street-lamps
alight after ten o'clock in any London suburb
in these times of martial law. Walthamstow
slept in heated but profound oblivion of its
mean existence. Beyond the town lay, like a
prostrate giant camel, the heat-blurred silhouette
of the classic forest. Low over Walthamstow
hung the festoons of flat, humid
clouds, menacing storm, but motionless.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
rhythm
of the
Zeppelin.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The train
to serve
as pilot to
London.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The
Zeppelin
forced to
travel low.</div>

<p>If there was no disturbance in the clouds
themselves there was among them something
very active, something that drilled its way
through them with a muffled whirring, something
that was oblong and lean and light of
texture, that was ominous and menacing for
all its buoyancy. The sound it made was too
high up, too thickly shrouded by clouds, to
determine its precise position. It gave forth
a breathing of persistent, definite rhythm.
This was plainly not the wing-stroke of a nocturnal
bird; for no bird, big or little, could
advertise its flight in such perfect pulsation.
And yet it was a bird, a Gargantuan, man-made
bird with murder in its talons and hatred
in its heart. From its steel nest in Germanized
Belgium this whirring monster had soared
eight thousand feet and crossed the Channel
with little fear of discovery. It had penetrated
the English Coast somewhere down Sheerness
way and over Southend and then, dropping
lower, had sought and found through the haze
the tiny train whose locomotive had just fluted
its brief salutation to Walthamstow. To the
close-cropped men on the Zeppelin, the string
of cars far down under their feet, with its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
side-flare from lighted windows, its engine's
headlamp and its sparks, had proved a providential
pilotage. They knew that this train
was on the main line, and that it would lead
them straight to the great Liverpool Street
Station, and that was London, and it was London
wharfs and ammunition works along the
Thames that they had planned to obliterate
with their cylinders of mechanical doom. But
the moist clouds which aided so materially in
hiding the Zeppelin's presence from below also
worked for its defeat, in so far as its ultimate
objective was concerned, for to keep the guiding
train in view it was compelled to travel
lower and yet lower&mdash;so low, indeed, as to
make it a target for Kitchener's sentinels.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The

"danger."</div>

<div class="sidenote">The train
stops at
Walthamstow.</div>

<p>Somehow, by sight or intuition or the instant
commingling of the two, old Tom Cumbers became
aware of the danger above him; for he
sprang to his switch, shut off all the cheery
blue and white lights along "the line" and
swung on with a mighty jerk the ruby signal
of danger. The engineer in the on-rushing
train jammed down his brakes and brought up
his locomotive with a complaining, grinding
moan, a hundred yards beyond Walthamstow
station. Tom Cumbers had done a greater
thing than any other in all his existence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
German
revenge.</div>

<p>That by his act the Germans in their speeding
sky-craft were baffled there is no doubt.
They had lost their trail of fire; their involuntary
guide had disappeared in the gloom. The
airmen's long journey had suddenly become
fruitless; their peril from hidden British guns
and flying scouts was increased tenfold. The
heat of the night was as nothing to the hot
surge of disappointment that must have swept
the brains of the Zeppelin crew. Their commander,
too, must have lost his judgment utterly,
forgotten his sense of military effectiveness.
Whatever happened, he sacrificed his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
soul when he turned his cloud-ship aside from
the railway line, steered over the shabby roofs
of Walthamstow and, at less than two thousand
feet, unloosed his iron dogs of destruction.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Bombing
tenements
of a defenseless
town.</div>

<p>I have it on the authority of experienced
aviators that it is not impossible on a dark
night to distinguish buildings of importance
like St. Paul's or the Houses of Parliament or
a great gun factory or a river as broad as the
Thames with its uprearing and frequent
bridges. The crowding tenements of Walthamstow
could have had no semblance to any of
these, at any height. It would seem a cheap
and worthless revenge, then, to wreck an unimportant
and defenceless town, having failed
to wreck the military nerve-center of the
world's metropolis. But this is what one of
Count Zeppelin's soaring dreadnoughts did
in this night, in this blood-drenched year.</p>


<div class="sidenote">When a
bomb
explodes.</div>

<p>Like the mirage of a tropical island the
dirigible hung motionless in space for a breathless
minute. There was a wavering pin-prick
of light in the carriage suspended from the
leviathan's belly&mdash;a light that fluttered fore
and aft as of a man with a fairy lantern running
to and fro giving orders or taking them.
Then faintly discernible against the sky, like
a rope hung down for anchorage, came a thin,
gray streak&mdash;the tail of a bomb with all hell
in its wake. From somewhere near the town's
centre the earth split and roared apart. The
world reeled and a brain-shattering crash compounded
of all the elements of pain and hurled
from the shoulders of a thousand thunderclaps
smote the senses. It was a blast of sickening
and malignant fury. It did not so much stun
as it stopped one&mdash;stopped the breath and the
heart's beat, suspending thought, halting life
itself for a fraction of time. One was, somehow,
aware of existence but without sensation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
And then came reaction and the realization of
what was really taking place. The German's
bomb landed fully ten blocks away, but you
would have taken oath in court that it had
fallen at your feet, behind you, above you and
into your very brain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Terror of
the
people.</div>

<div class="sidenote">A broken
gas main.</div>

<p>An air raid on Walthamstow, which drab
town can boast neither ammunition works nor
the ownership of war material of any description,
could not be at once realized. But here
was the cyclonic fact, hideously real, appallingly
actual; and there in the heavens was
the buoyant Zeppelin maneuvering for further
mischief. The reverberation of the first explosion
was still grumbling back in Epping
Forest when all Walthamstow, rubbing its
eyes, tumbled out into the black streets. Men,
women, children, all ludicrously clotheless,
swarmed aimlessly like bees in an overturned
hive. Stark terror gripped them. It distorted
their faces and set their legs quivering. The
dullest among these toil-dulled people knew
what that explosion meant, knew that it was
part of the punishment promised by the German
foe. "Gott strafe England" had come to
pass. But they could not understand why the
enemy had singled them out for such drastic
distinction. The more alert and cool-headed
of the men battled with their fellows and
shouted instructions to get the women folks
and the kiddies back indoors and down into
their cellars. The night-gowned and pajamaed
throng could not be persuaded that safety lay
not in sight of the Zeppelin but away from it.
The hypnotism of horror lured them on to
where twelve houses lay spread about in smoking
chaos, a plateau of blazing and noisome
havoc. Somewhere a gas-main burst with a
roar and drove the crowd back with its
choking fumes as no human hands could have
done. Women frankly hysterical or swooning<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
were roughly thrust aside. Children shrieking
in uncomprehending panic were swept
along with the crowd or trodden upon. Lumbering
men ran and shouted and cursed and
shook hairy fists at the long blot on the clouds.
Some of the men leaped over iron palings like
startled rabbits and flung themselves in the
grass, face downward and quaking. And yet,
I dare say that most of these would have
walked straight into a familiar danger without
the waver of an eyelash; it was the unknown
peril, the doubt as to how and whence
this hurtling death might spring upon them
out of the night, that unhinged their manhood.
And while Walthamstow's walls went down
and great flame-tongues spouted where homes
had stood, while the thick, hot air was tortured
with agonized and inhuman cries, the enemy
up above let loose another bolt.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
second
bomb as
the town
blazes.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Effects
of the
explosion.</div>

<p>More terrible than the first explosion was,
or seemed, this second one. It mowed down
half a hundred shrieking souls. And it was
curious to note the lateral action of the blast
when it hit a resisting surface. Dynamite explodes
with a downward or upward force, lyddite
and nitro-glycerine and what not other
devil's own powers act more or less in the same
set manner. But the furious ingredients of
these bombs hurled on Walthamstow contained
stuff that released a discharge which swept
all things from it horizontally, in a quarter-mile,
lightning sweep, like a scythe of flame.
A solid block of shabby villas was laid out as
flat as your palm by the explosion of this
second bomb. Scarcely a brick was left standing
upright. What houses escaped demolition
around the edge of the convulsion had their
doors and windows splintered into rubbish.
The concussion of this chemical frenzy was
felt, like an earthquake, in a ten-mile circle.
Wherever the scorching breath of the bombs<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
breathed on stone or metal it left a sulphurous,
yellow-white veneer, acrid in odor and smooth
to the touch. Whole street-lengths of twisted
iron railings were coated with this murderous
white-wash.</p>

<div class="sidenote">More
bombs as
the Zeppelin
rises.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Freaks
of the
explosion.</div>

<p>Having made sure of its mark, the ravaging
Zeppelin rose higher on the discharge of its
first bomb and still higher after firing the second.
At the safe distance of four thousand
feet it dropped three more shells recklessly,
haphazard. One of these bored cleanly through
a slate-tiled roof, through furniture and two
floorings and burrowed ten feet into the ground
without exploding. This intact shell has since
been carefully analyzed by the experts of the
Board of Explosions at the British War Office.
Another bomb detonated on the steel rails of
the Walthamstow tram-line and sent them
curling skyward from their rivetted foundations
like serpentine wisps of paper. Great cobblestones
were heaved through shop windows
and partitions and out into the flower-beds of
rear gardens; some of the cobbles were flung
through solid attic blinds and others were
catapulted through brick walls a foot in thickness.
A hole as big as a moving-van burned
into the road at one place. In a side street an
impromptu fountain squirted playfully into the
dust-burdened air, the result of a central water-pipe
punctured by a slug from one of the bomb's
iron entrails. But these things were not noted
until dawn and comparative peace had returned
to Walthamstow and men could count with
some degree the cost of the reckless invasion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">British
aeroplanes
pursue.</div>

<p>Before the clouds had swallowed up the hateful
visitant the noise of its attack had aroused
the military guards across Epping Forest, in
Chingford village, and, aided by a search-light,
the anti-aircraft-gun opened its unavailing fire
on the Zeppelin&mdash;ineffective, except that its
returning shrapnel smashed up several roofs<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
and battered some innocent heads. The Germans
had gauged their skyward path to London
along which, apparently, they felt reasonably
safe from gun-reach. But they had barely
headed homeward before a flock of army aeroplanes,
rising from all points of the compass,
were in hot pursuit. One of the Britishers was
shot down by the men aboard the Zeppelin.
Neither speed nor daring counts for much in
an encounter between flying-machines and swift
dirigibles of the latest types. The advantage
lies solely with the one that can overfly his adversary.
This can be achieved by a biplane or
monoplane pilot only if he has a long start from
the ground and time enough to surmount his
opponent. This is difficult even in daylight
with a cloudless sky. Given darkness and
clouds, the chances for success are tremendously
against the smaller craft.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The old
switchman
a
victim.</div>

<p>Eight bombs in all were launched on Walthamstow&mdash;two
of them ineffectual. The sixth
bomb fell into a field close beside the railway
line and worked a hideous wonder. It blew
into never-to-be-gathered fragments all that
was mortal of old Tom Cumbers, the signalman.
They found only his left hand plastered
gruesomely against the grassy bank of the railway
cut&mdash;not a hair nor button else.</p>

<p>The great series of attacks by the massed German
Army against the mighty forces of Verdun
began in February, 1917, and continued
throughout the following months. Taken as a
